<p>When exploring the world of Don't Starve, it is inevitable that the player will stumble upon monsters that can pose a threat or are there to kill them. This WIP guide is designed to assist players in dealing with monsters in all situations, rain or snow.
</p>
<nav class="toc" id="toc"><div id="toctitle"><h2>Contents</h2><span class="toctoggle">[<a class="internal" data-hide="hide" data-show="show" href="#.html" id="togglelink">show</a>]</span></div><ol></ol></nav>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Equipment">Equipment</span></h2>
<p>While your character can actually brawl and punch enemies to death, most playable characters in Don't starve are not known for their physical prowess and even the smallest of the enemies will easily outdamage and kill your character if unprepared, so you'll need weapons for dealing damage, and armor for your character to wear for protection.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Weapons"><a href="Weapons.html" title="Weapons">Weapons</a></span></h3>
<p>Almost every item that the character can wield in his/her hands can be used as a weapon (except for Divining rods). From fishing rods to pickaxes, and from walking canes to dark swords, every item that can be placed in the Hands slot of a certain character has its own damage value and can be used to hit enemies. This section will not cover traps, since their main usage is for stationary defenses.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Melee_Weapons"><a href="Weapons#Melee_Weapons.html" title="Weapons">Melee Weapons</a></span></h4>
<ul><li>Most tools in the game (<a class="new" href="Axes?action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="Axes (page does not exist)">Axes</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Pickaxes.html" title="Pickaxes">Pickaxes</a>, <a class="new" href="Shovels?action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" title="Shovels (page does not exist)">Shovels</a>,...) can be used as weapons. While their damage is subpar and each hit makes them lose durability, they're still a decent way of dealing damage and their gold variation makes them renewable, provided a Pig King is spawned or you <a class="mw-redirect" href="Cave.html" title="Cave">spelunk</a> from time to time.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Your main weapon for the entire game will be probably the <a href="Spear.html" title="Spear">Spear</a>, easily craftable and with good enough damage against most enemies. Because flint is a renewable resource due to earthquakes in caves, the spear is a renewable weapon. Another powerful weapon is <a href="Ham_Bat.html" title="Ham Bat">Ham Bat</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Your preferred weapon for the entire game will be the <a href="Tentacle_Spike.html" title="Tentacle Spike">Tentacle Spike</a>. While you probably will not actively farm Tentacles for their spikes, always be on the lookout in swamp biomes for traces of nearby battles (like silk, glands, rot, fish, monster meat...). Swamp denizens like Spiders, Merms and Tentacles like to spend their days happily engaged fighting each other, so you'll easily find "phat loot" around their chosen battlefield. As long as tentacles are involved, there's a decent chance for a spike or two to be found nearby.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>The most damaging weapon in the game is the <a href="Dark_Sword.html" title="Dark Sword">Dark Sword</a>, but it's difficult to craft and wielding it gradually reduces sanity, so you will only rely on it for difficult fights, times when you want to reduce sanity on purpose, boss mobs which likely drain sanity to zero anyway, or when using <a href="Maxwell_(Character).html" title="Maxwell (Character)">Maxwell</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Finally, while it's weaker than most tools (see above), the <a href="Walking_Cane.html" title="Walking Cane">Walking Cane</a> can be used as a great weapon since it has no durability and thus can never be destroyed. The cane may be especially useful for destroying structures (ex. Spider Dens) and easily kiteable enemies (ex. Koalefants) that require a large number of hits to be destroyed or killed. It will also give the wielder a speed boost to make kiting easier.
</li></ul>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ranged_Weapons"><a href="Weapons#Ranged_Weapons.html" title="Weapons">Ranged Weapons</a></span></h4>
<ul><li>The most basic ranged weapon your character will use is the <a href="Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">Boomerang</a>. Its main utility is to engage "frightened-type" enemies (such as <a href="Koalefant.html" title="Koalefant">Koalefants</a> and <a href="Gobbler.html" title="Gobbler">Gobblers</a>), and to grant safer first strikes against enemies you need to isolate for any reason (<a class="mw-redirect" href="Chess_Monsters.html" title="Chess Monsters">Chess Pieces</a>, <a href="Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">Beefalo</a>). Boomerangs return to your character once they strike their target, and you need to "catch" it; if your character stays stationary after the boomerang has been thrown, you may just hold down the Spacebar button and you will catch it automatically, but in case you move your character the boomerang will "home in" to your new location and you will have to time a Spacebar press to catch it manually. If you fail the catch, the boomerang will hit you in return, damage your character while losing more durability, and fall to the ground.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Darts are the second most useful ranged weapons in the game and are somewhat easy to craft. There are three different types of darts, each one requiring two <a href="Cut_Reeds.html" title="Cut Reeds">Cut Reeds</a> (gathered around <a href="Marsh.html" title="Marsh">swamp</a> biomes) a type of bird feather (dependent on the dart type), and an extra component (dependent on the dart type). Each dart has only one use, but darts can stack up to x20 for every kind.
<ol><li><a href="Blow_Dart.html" title="Blow Dart">Blow Darts</a>: Deals heavy damage to a single target. Will kill most non-boss creatures with 3 to 5 darts. The entire <a href="MacTusk_N%27_Son.html" title="MacTusk N' Son">MacTusk Hunting Party</a> can potentially be killed with only five darts, since each dart does 100 damage.
</li><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Sleep_Dart.html" title="Sleep Dart">Sleep Darts</a>: Will put most creatures to sleep, from one dart for small creatures to 4 darts for boss-type creatures.
</li><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Fire_Dart.html" title="Fire Dart">Fire Darts</a>: Sets most targets on fire. Be aware that the burning target may set nearby flammable materials ablaze, spreading the fire.
</li></ol>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>The <a href="Fire_Staff.html" title="Fire Staff">Fire Staff</a> is also used to set targets on fire. It has 20 charges and your character's sanity drops by 1 every time you use it. Similar to the fire dart, targets set ablaze may spread the fire.
</li><li>The <a href="Ice_Staff.html" title="Ice Staff">Ice Staff</a> is used to freeze enemies in their tracks for a short time; small enemies will be frozen with a single blast while larger ones may need up to 4 blasts; any enemy struck by a blast but not frozen will be chilled instead, becoming whiter in color and moving slower. It holds 20 charges, drops the character's sanity by 1 each time it's used, and as long as it's worn, drops the character's temperature at a faster rate.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Armor"><a href="Armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a></span></h3>
<p>Most creatures deal a great amount of damage and can wear down a character in a relatively small number of hits. Armor offers protection by absorbing a percentage of the damage dealt by an enemy hit, losing durability in the process.
</p><p>Characters may wear armor on both their head and their torso, stacking multiplicatively against enemy attacks (which means, the <u><b>last equipped armor</b></u> absorbs a percentage of the initial damage, and then, the <u><b>armor equipped in first place</b></u> absorbs a percent of the damage that bypassed the first damage reduction). Finally  the damage that bypasses both armors is then received by your character. For more in-depth info and theorycraft, check <a href="Armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a>.
</p>
<ul><li>While they grant the least amount of protection, <a href="Grass_Suit.html" title="Grass Suit">Grass Suits</a> and <a href="Log_Suit.html" title="Log Suit">Log Suits</a> are easily renewable. <a href="Marble_Suit.html" title="Marble Suit">Marble Suits</a> and <a href="Night_Armour.html" title="Night Armour">Night Armour</a> are much more protective, but more difficult to craft because of the needed materials. They also come with drawbacks: the Marble Suit slows characters down when worn; Night Armour drains sanity while worn and whenever damage is received.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>As for the head armor, the <a href="Football_Helmet.html" title="Football Helmet">Football Helmet</a> is the most easily renewable, as long as one can farm <a href="Pig_Skin.html" title="Pig Skin">Pig Skins</a>. The <a href="Shelmet.html" title="Shelmet">Shelmet</a> requires venturing into <a class="mw-redirect" href="Cave.html" title="Cave">Caves</a>, but can be received as a rare drop from <a href="Slurtle.html" title="Slurtle">Slurtles</a>. Finally, the <a href="Beekeeper_Hat.html" title="Beekeeper Hat">Beekeeper Hat</a> only works against bees, making it most useful for active bee and honey farming.
</li><li>With a Football Helmet and a Log Suit, two easily obtained and also renewable pieces of armor, you have a 96% damage reduction. This means that powerful monsters, such as the <a href="Deerclops.html" title="Deerclops">Deerclops</a>, will do a negligible amount of damage- the Deerclops would only do 3 damage.
</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Creature_Behavior"><a href="Mobs.html" title="Mobs">Creature</a> Behavior</span></h2>
<p>Creatures in Don't Starve may be separated in classes, depending on their normal behavior against external threats and character proximity.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Passive">Passive</span></h3>
<p>Passive creatures will never attack your character or other creatures, even if they are being dealt damage and will actively avoid your character if he/she gets too close.Passive creatures are:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="Butterfly.html" title="Butterfly">Butterflies</a>. Will keep flying between nearby flowers unless the player gets too close, in which case they will begin to fly away.
</li><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Rabbits.html" title="Rabbits">Rabbits</a> (and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Beardlings.html" title="Beardlings">Beardlings</a>). Will run to their designated rabbit hole. If your character stands beween the hole and the rabbit, they will actively run away from your character if you're giving chase, or run towards the hole, then away from your character once they get near if you stand still.
</li><li><a href="Birds.html" title="Birds">Birds</a>. If your character approaches while they're grounded, will immediately take off and fly away.
</li><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Gobblers.html" title="Gobblers">Gobblers</a>. Will try to hide in a nearby <a class="mw-redirect" href="Berry_bush.html" title="Berry bush">Berry bush</a> when evening hits or actively move away from your character if caught in open ground.
</li><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Snurtle.html" title="Snurtle">Snurtles</a>. Will move toward rocks as <a href="Slurtle.html" title="Slurtle">Slurtles</a> do, but will flee if the character is close.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Neutral.C2.A0">Neutral </span></h3>
<p>Neutral creatures tolerate your character and other creatures' presence and will only fight back if attacked first or threatened. 
</p><p>While some neutral creatures won't mind your character's presence and allow it to an extent, others will actively avoid your character, and to engage them your character will either need a ranged weapon or need to corner them against the terrain or a structure.
</p><p>Neutral, non-"frightened" creatures are:
</p>
<ul><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Beefalos.html" title="Beefalos">Beefalos</a> (while not in their mating season)

<p><br/>
<i>(1)<a class="mw-redirect" href="Treeguards.html" title="Treeguards">Treeguards</a> will only attack the creature that chops down a nearby tree (the final "chop" that cuts down the tree itself); while most of the time will be your character, if your character has befriended a <a href="Pig.html" title="Pig">Pig</a> and is the pig the creature that lands the last chop on the tree, the Treeguard will attack the Pig while staying neutral to your character, still being an active creature in the world. Pacified Treeguards (those put to sleep before by planting pine cones) will stay neutral unless attacked.</i>
</p><p><i>(2) While <a class="mw-redirect" href="Pigs.html" title="Pigs">Pigs</a>, <a href="Bunnyman.html" title="Bunnyman">Bunnymen</a>  and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Smallish_Tallbird.html" title="Smallish Tallbird">Smallish Tallbirds</a> will not actively run away from you and may even step into the player, they will quickly fall back a short distance if you (or themselves) move too close to each other.</i>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Aggressive">Aggressive</span></h3>
<p>Aggressive creatures will immediately attack your character (and natural enemies) when they get too close to each other.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Basic_Combat_Mechanics">Basic Combat Mechanics</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stunlocking">Stunlocking</span></h3>
<p>Small enemies in the game are vulnerable to stunlocking; a stunlockable monster being hit by any kind of attack will become stunned for a small time frame; if your character keeps attacking the monster repeatedly the stun timer will continually reset allowing the monster to be killed without any kind of retaliation
</p><p>Creatures currently vulnerable to stunlocking (as of game version <b>The End of the Beginning</b>)

</li></ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Kiting">Kiting</span></h3>
<p>Kiting, (also known as Hit-and-Run) is the action of running back and forth between creature attacks, hitting the creatures in the small time frame available before they start attacking again. Kiting itself may refer to both Defensive Kiting and Offensive Kiting mechanics.
The standard kiting mechanic when fighting <b>lone</b>, kiteable creatures, is the following:
</p>
<ol><li>Stay in motion, constantly moving away from the enemy.
</li><li>Wait for the enemy to start its attack animation.
</li><li>Keep moving and stop a short distance away, until the attack animation of the creature ends.
</li><li>Immediately move towards the creature and start attacking. If you know that creature's Attack Period, land as many hits as you believe you can get during that time frame. If you're not sure, best is to land just one or two hits.
</li><li>Repeat from 1 until the creature is dead.
</li></ol>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Defensive_Kiting">Defensive Kiting</span></h4>
<p>All <b>melee</b> monsters in the game are vulnerable to defensive kiting. As long as your character keeps moving "away" (doesn't need to be in an exact straight line, just the general direction) from the creature when it starts their attack animation, your character will outrange the creature attack radius before the animation ends, counting that attack as a "miss". 
</p><p>Defensive kiting is less effective against monsters that attack in packs since you may get attacked from several angles at the same time, with separate attack timers.
</p><p>The most common <i><b>exception</b></i> to this mechanic are <b>ranged</b> monsters, since projectile speeds are always faster than movement speeds and thus, no creature can outrange a projectile. You'll need to run in a zig-zag pattern, or make a turn once a ranged attack animation starts to avoid those kind of attacks. 
</p><p>Ranged creatures <b>not</b> vulnerable to defensive kiting are: 
</p>
<ul><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Mac_Tusk.html" title="Mac Tusk">Mac Tusk</a>
</li><li><a class="mw-redirect" href="Clockwork_Bishops.html" title="Clockwork Bishops">Clockwork Bishops</a>
</li></ul>
<p>Also, some creatures in the game have developed a defensive kiting behavior themselves, thus, once engaged, will stay in motion, continually moving away from their <b>main target</b> (which can be the player or another creature) until their attack period is reset. Creatures with defensive kiting behavior will only kite the enemy they are attacking, thus, other enemies may land attacks normally as long as they can predict their movement well enough to position themselves.
</p><p>Creatures with defensive kiting mechanics:
</p>
<ul><li><a href="Bee.html" title="Bee">Bees</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Killer_Bees.html" title="Killer Bees">Killer Bees</a> (while not actively kiting, will usually move a short distance away after most attacks)

</li></ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Offensive_Kiting">Offensive Kiting</span></h4>
<p>Most creatures in the game are vulnerable to offensive kiting. Once creatures end their attack animation several seconds must pass until they can attack again; on these seconds most creatures will either stand still, make some kind of animation (barking, growling,...) or will keep moving towards you if they're melee, readying themselves for their next attack. Your character may use that time to hit the creatures several times without any kind of retaliation, then start a defensive kiting procedure once their attack period is reset.

<p>While this does work for many hostile mobs, some are more difficult and require a more advanced approach.
</p><p>Hostle creatures have a so-called "aggro radius". A "personal space" around them that will make them hostile towards your character or natural enemies if you (or them) cross it. Highly aggressive creatures have a very large aggro radius, while less aggressive creatures have a much smaller one. In this guide, the aggro radius will be measured in <a class="mw-redirect" href="Berry_Bushes.html" title="Berry Bushes">Berry Bushes</a> to give players a rough estimate.
