<p><b>Adventure Mode</b> is a story/campaign mode of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="Don%27t_Starve.html" title="Don't Starve">Don't Starve</a></i>. In Adventure Mode, the player enters a battle of wits and endurance against the game's mastermind, <a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a>. The world is split into successive chapters with their own themes, introduced by Maxwell. The objective of each chapter is to survive, gather all four pieces of the <a href="Wooden_Thing.html" title="Wooden Thing">Wooden Thing</a>, assemble it, and activate it in order to progress to the next chapter.
</p><p>Players can take up to four items of their choice with them when teleporting between chapters. Wilson's <a href="Beard.html" title="Beard">Beard</a> does not count as an item, so it is maintained. <a href="WX-78.html" title="WX-78">WX-78</a>'s stat increases from eating <a href="Gears.html" title="Gears">Gears</a> also is carried over between chapters. Any character-specific item will also be replaced, meaning you don't have to bring them with you. Also any built but not yet placed structures will carry over with the player, ready to be deployed in the next world.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Entering_Adventure_Mode"> Entering Adventure Mode </span></h2>
<p>The player reaches Adventure Mode from <a href="Sandbox_Mode.html" title="Sandbox Mode">Sandbox Mode</a> by activating <a href="Maxwell%27s_Door.html" title="Maxwell's Door">Maxwell's Door</a>. The player is not allowed to bring anything over from Sandbox Mode (including learned recipes). If the player dies in Adventure Mode, they will wake up in Sandbox mode in the same state as they left it; the player can then immediately try again if they wish. Visiting Adventure Mode always starts the player at the very first chapter and a newly generated map, irrespective of previous attempts.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Worlds">Worlds</span></h2>
<p>At the start of each level and every time the player loads up an Adventure game the title of the level is displayed and the number of chapter. The length of Adventure Mode is 5 chapters plus an Epilogue. The order of appearance for most worlds is chosen at random. However, in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th world, the map will show some of the path indicating where the objectives are. A world only appears once in an Adventure play-through. There are more worlds than chapters, which means that some worlds may not appear.

<p><i>"Oh, You found my portal did you? You'd think you would have learned your lesson by now. Hmm. Let's try something a little more challenging, shall we?"</i>
</p><p>— <i><b><a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a> greeting the player</b></i>
</p><p>A Cold Reception is an ordinary world except that it Rains during the summer which Lasts 6 days and snows in winter which lasts 3 days. This makes exploration difficult. In addition, daytime will never exceed one third of the day and significantly less during winter. Players are more vulnerable to insanity and freezing as you have to face near-constant rain or snow and much less daylight. Due to the seasons being so short it is unlikely to see a Deerclops in the first several winters.
</p><p>There will always be at least one resource which is very rare. Sometimes the level generated will not have many <a href="Sapling.html" title="Sapling">Saplings</a>, but a lot of <a href="Spiky_Bush.html" title="Spiky Bush">Spiky Bushes</a> instead; other times <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grass.html" title="Grass">Grass</a> might be either scarce or there might be plenty, but it's all pre-picked and needs to be fertilized. This makes it difficult to survive the winter with <a class="mw-redirect" href="Traps.html" title="Traps">traps</a> . There also might be no <a class="mw-redirect" href="Evergreen.html" title="Evergreen">trees</a>, only stumps everywhere. Your food sources are limited; there are few <a class="mw-redirect" href="Berry_Bushes.html" title="Berry Bushes">Berry Bushes</a> (if any) and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Carrots.html" title="Carrots">Carrots</a> can be rare.  Also, when farming Berry Bushes and other plants, there will be a far greater chance of an unfortunate lightning strikes (due to the near-constant rain) so lightning rods are a necessity.
</p><p>When complete, this level should feel similar to a survival level, but with increased pressure on all players' resources. At least one <a href="Things.html" title="Things">thing</a> will be on an island connected by a bridge that serves as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Guardian_Pig.html" title="Guardian Pig">Guardian Pig</a> checkpoint which can make it quite tough to get to. However, this means that players will also find a <a href="Pig_King.html" title="Pig King">Pig King</a> on the island. The constant rain also means that players will most likely be getting quite a lot of frogs at first but players can use them to their advantage as well as the most abundant food source.
</p><p><b>Tips:</b>
</p>
<ul><li> If this is your first level try to learn as many <a href="Crafting.html" title="Crafting">Recipes</a> as you need, because you will keep them through the Adventure Mode.
</li><li> It's important not to attack <a class="mw-redirect" href="Frogs.html" title="Frogs">Frogs</a> when other Frogs are nearby, because all Frogs will chase and attack you. Try to kite the Frogs until they give up chasing you.
</li><li> Alternatively, you can trap Frogs and they will supply a consistent food source. Other Frogs in the area will not aggro when you trap them provided you don't attack them.
</li><li> If this is not your first level, prepare a farm (in the previous level) to place, as the plentiful rain makes crops grow incredibly fast.
</li><li> Keep in mind that <a class="mw-redirect" href="Straw_Roll.html" title="Straw Roll">Straw Rolls</a> and <a href="Tent.html" title="Tent">Tents</a> are very useful to skip the night and replenish <a href="Sanity.html" title="Sanity">Sanity</a> level during this mode. However, it is important to remember that sleeping restores sanity at a cost of <a href="Hunger.html" title="Hunger">Hunger</a> and is not highly recommended due to the low food sources.
</li><li> There are a few sources of food on the level. There are a lot of <a href="Rabbit.html" title="Rabbit">Rabbit Holes</a> on the map. <a href="Tallbird.html" title="Tallbird">Tallbirds</a> are on the map as well, and if you find it they generally fight Frogs. If a Tallbird does not die to Frogs, kiting and killing it is a good skill that will bring <a href="Meat.html" title="Meat">Meat</a>, <a href="Tallbird_Egg.html" title="Tallbird Egg">Tallbird Egg</a>, and <a href="Frog_Legs.html" title="Frog Legs">Frog Legs</a> if any Frogs were killed by Tallbird. And last, but not least, usually <a href="Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">Beefalos</a>. All of these methods increase <a class="mw-redirect" href="Naughtiness.html" title="Naughtiness">Naughtiness</a>, so be wary of <a href="Krampus.html" title="Krampus">Krampus</a> !
</li><li> There are several areas that are blocked off by <a href="Spider_Den.html" title="Spider Den">Spider Dens</a>. Building 6 or more Traps and luring wave after wave of <a href="Spider.html" title="Spider">Spiders</a> into it is one way to clean it. Another is to attempt to burn the Spider Dens down, but this is only recommended when the Spider Dens are in a <a href="Forest.html" title="Forest">Forest</a>, where you would first light a tree on fire. You can also run in, plant a <a href="Pine_Cone.html" title="Pine Cone">Pine Cone</a> as close to the den as possible, then return when it is grown and light it. If you are just started and your area does not provide resources to make Traps, you can try and run through the Spider Dens at cost of <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a>.
</li><li> It is possible to travel to <b>Archipelago</b>,<b> The Game is Afoot</b>, or <b>King of Winter</b>, which has an infinite <a href="Winter.html" title="Winter">Winter</a>. Taking with you <a href="Rabbit_Earmuff.html" title="Rabbit Earmuff">Rabbit Earmuffs</a> (worst), <a href="Winter_Hat.html" title="Winter Hat">Winter Hat</a> (ok), or <a href="Beefalo_Hat.html" title="Beefalo Hat">Beefalo Hat</a> (best) will help greatly in those levels.
</li><li> Keep on your feet in the day/evening by stopping only to pick up food and the bare minimum for tools. Use every other night to set a <a href="Campfire.html" title="Campfire">campfire</a> by trees so players may chop trees and cook carrots. Between those nights, keep moving by <a href="Torch.html" title="Torch">Torch</a>, using reduced vision to gather <a href="Twigs.html" title="Twigs">Twigs</a> and <a href="Cut_Grass.html" title="Cut Grass">Cut Grass</a>, and to shave Beefalos. Make a base only if this is your first world and you need to prototype useful items, or it's the 4th one and you want to prepare for the next world.
</li><li> An <a href="Umbrella.html" title="Umbrella">Umbrella</a> is highly recommended because your <a href="Sanity.html" title="Sanity">Sanity</a> will drop very very quickly in the near constant <a href="Rain.html" title="Rain">Rain</a>.
</li><li> With rain comes lightning, so <a href="WX-78.html" title="WX-78">WX-78</a> will have trouble with sanity unless using an umbrella. Carry cooked Green or Blue Mushrooms, picked during dusk and night.
</li><li> Consider gathering <a href="Flower.html" title="Flower">Flowers</a> and using them to craft a <a href="Garland.html" title="Garland">Garland</a>. Picking Flowers will restore Sanity and Garland will help combat Sanity loss due to Rain and forgoing sleep for the first few days. If you manage to get an <a href="Alchemy_Engine.html" title="Alchemy Engine">Alchemy Engine</a> and x6 <a href="Silk.html" title="Silk">Silk</a> than you will be able to craft a <a href="Top_Hat.html" title="Top Hat">Top Hat</a>, which restores 3.3 Sanity/min. Rain drains 3.3 Sanity/min., so it makes 0 Sanity loss.
</li><li>A quick and easy (but risky) way to get past blocked off areas such as the Pig Guardian checkpoint is to place 1 cut grass next to the wood wall and light it with a torch.
</li><li> As the rain is frequent during summer, more combustible material is needed to maintain fire. Charcoal stacks up to 40 and will be in great supply when the large forests catch fire because of lightning strikes.
</li><li> When trying to find the Things, if you are on an island-like landform, walk around all the edges of it with the divining rod as you have a good chance to pick up a signal without having to explore too much of the island. This does <i>NOT</i> work if the island is too large.

<p><i>"Well, would you look at that, you survived. One down, four to go!"</i>
</p><p>— <i><b><a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a> greeting the player</b></i>
</p><p>Players are spawned in a <a href="Grasslands.html" title="Grasslands">Grasslands</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="Biome.html" title="Biome">Biome</a> . Maxwell informs that endless winter has already begun, burning <a class="mw-redirect" href="Evergreen.html" title="Evergreen">trees</a> are around players to prevent from freezing while players hearing Maxwell's dialogue. Players can look forward to 1.5–3 minutes of daytime while juggling the effects of <a href="Freezing.html" title="Freezing">freezing</a>, starvation, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Insanity.html" title="Insanity">insanity</a> ever-present in this harsh climate. On the other hand, nights don't last long in this world. It also introduces <a class="mw-redirect" href="Hound_Mounds.html" title="Hound Mounds">Hound Mounds</a>, identified by animal <a href="Bones.html" title="Bones">Bones</a> on the ground. These are usually on a small area or island of their own, guarding a location on the map forcing players to go through if players want to get all the pieces. <a href="Deerclops.html" title="Deerclops">Deerclops</a> seems to spawn on day 7 to 9. If players ignore him and leave him somewhere, it will prevent him from respawning somewhere closer. However, his eye can help players gain <a href="Hunger.html" title="Hunger">Hunger</a> and <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a> back while also reducing your <a href="Sanity.html" title="Sanity">sanity</a> if you need to go through some Obelisks. This may not be worth the risk in the earlier days, unless you have brought a durable <a href="Log_Suit.html" title="Log Suit">Log Suit</a> and <a href="Football_Helmet.html" title="Football Helmet">Football Helmet</a> combination to shield from damage. 
</p><p>The journey will be blocked by a group of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Boulders.html" title="Boulders">Boulders</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="Obelisks.html" title="Obelisks">Obelisks</a>. For the latter, players may need to have a certain level of sanity (either low or high level) in order to pass through the <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bridges.html" title="Bridges">Bridges</a>.
</p><p>The world is permanently winter. The aim is to survive the cold without any preparation time. Do not try to stay here for long; find a place on the first 2 to 3 days to collect as many items as possible and get some food but then just go exploring as quick as you can to find the rest of the pieces.

<figure class="article-thumb tright" style="width: 300px"> <a class="image" href="File:Strange_Obelish.png.html"><img alt="Strange Obelish" class="thumbimage" data-image-key="Strange_Obelish.png" data-image-name="Strange Obelish.png" height="169" src="img/300px-Strange_Obelish.png" width="300"/></a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>
<p>This is one of the more difficult levels to start in because players initially have no way of keeping warm except for the Heat Stone, which isn't very effective. It is not a bad idea to stay here a little bit longer to prepare for the levels ahead. Getting the <a href="Tam_o%27_Shanter.html" title="Tam o' Shanter">Tam o' Shanter</a> is very helpful to raise your sanity back up when players have to go insane to get through the Obelisks.
</p><p>Near the start location will be a dead adventurer with a backpack containing a schematic for one random invention, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Heat_Stone.html" title="Heat Stone">Heat Stone</a>, some <a href="Log.html" title="Log">Logs</a>, <a href="Cut_Grass.html" title="Cut Grass">Cut Grass</a> and a <a href="Torch.html" title="Torch">Torch</a>. Sometimes the backpack may also contain a <a href="Red_Gem.html" title="Red Gem">Red Gem</a> and several <a href="Nightmare_Fuel.html" title="Nightmare Fuel">Nightmare Fuels</a> . Also, lying nearby is a schematic for <a class="mw-redirect" href="Rabbit_Earmuffs.html" title="Rabbit Earmuffs">Rabbit Earmuffs</a>, a <a href="Divining_Rod.html" title="Divining Rod">Divining Rod</a> and an <a href="Axe.html" title="Axe">Axe</a> .
</p><p><b>General Tips:</b>
</p><p><span style="line-height:20px;">This is a very difficult level and it might take you more than 3 tries to pass this. It depends on the number of obelisks crossing you will get in the level, also the type and amount of natural resources available (e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="Rabbits.html" title="Rabbits">Rabbits</a> may not be present at all, or limited <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grass.html" title="Grass">grass</a> in a sector).</span>
</p>
<ul><li> Because Obelisks will block your passage, it's important to know how to pass through them. There are 2 types of Obelisks. One requires you to have high Sanity, another requires you to have low Sanity. You will need 15% maximum sanity (30 for most characters) or lower to pass through the low one.
<ul><li> Reduce Sanity by collecting (-5), eating (-5) or standing nearby (-25/min) <a class="mw-redirect" href="Evil_Flowers.html" title="Evil Flowers">Evil Flowers</a>/<a class="mw-redirect" href="Dark_Petal.html" title="Dark Petal">Dark Petals</a>, eating <a href="Meat.html" title="Meat">Raw Meat</a> (-10), eating <a class="mw-redirect" href="Cooked_Monster_Meat.html" title="Cooked Monster Meat">Cooked Monster Meat</a> (-10), digging up <a class="mw-redirect" href="Graves.html" title="Graves">graves</a> (-10), eating raw <a class="mw-redirect" href="Green_Cap.html" title="Green Cap">Green Cap</a> (-50), and more. Refer to <a href="Sanity.html" title="Sanity">Sanity</a> list.
</li><li> Restore <a href="Sanity.html" title="Sanity">Sanity</a> by picking up <a href="Flower.html" title="Flower">Flowers</a> (+5), and eating <a class="mw-redirect" href="Cooked_Green_Cap.html" title="Cooked Green Cap">Cooked Green Cap</a> (+15) at the price of -1 <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a>. If you have enough <a href="Monster_Meat.html" title="Monster Meat">Monster Meats</a>/<a href="Meat.html" title="Meat">Meats</a>, befriending a <a href="Pig.html" title="Pig">Pig</a> will help increase sanity (+25/min).
</li><li> Accumulation of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Green_Mushroom.html" title="Green Mushroom">Green Mushroom</a> is highly suggested before crossing a low sanity Obelisks so that you can cook to quickly restore sanity. 
</li></ul>
</li><li> Timing is important when moving between 'sectors' that are split off by <span style="line-height:21px;">low level sanity </span>Obelisks. Make sure you gather enough resources in case the new sector is lacking a particular resource (e.g. Boulders) and if you are unable to return to the previous location; as being insane can make it more difficuit with <a class="mw-redirect" href="Hallucination#Crawling_Horror.html" title="Hallucination">Crawling Horror</a> threats.
</li><li> If you happen to start in or find a 'rich' resource area, you might want to consider staying in the area for a while to gather all its resources before moving to the next sector. Don't rush! 
</li><li> It is best to stand near a fire source until the Heat Stone is charged to max. When it's charged to max, it will turn orange in color. This will give you more time to explore before building a fire.
</li><li> <span style="line-height:20px;">If you have problems finding </span>Boulders<span style="line-height:20px;">, remember that those can be found in small numbers in the </span><a href="Forest.html" title="Forest">Forests</a><span style="line-height:20px;">. Also, </span><a href="Gold_Nugget.html" title="Gold Nugget">Gold Nuggets</a><span style="line-height:20px;"> can be scattered around </span><a href="Graveyard.html" title="Graveyard">Graveyards</a><span style="line-height:20px;">.</span>
</li><li> If you reach a choke point with <a class="mw-redirect" href="Hound_Mounds.html" title="Hound Mounds">Hound Mounds</a>  scattered around, two of the ways to get through them is by using a Beefalo Horn to lure beefalos and distract the hounds while you destroy the mounds or flat out running, avoiding the hound's attacks until you reach a place where the hounds stop following you (it is useful to wear a feather hat, as this will attract birds which will take the hounds interest for a short time).
</li><li> Hounds from Hound Mounds, <a href="Tallbird.html" title="Tallbird">Tallbirds</a>, and even <a href="Deerclops.html" title="Deerclops">Deerclops</a> can also be taken out with use of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Tooth_Traps.html" title="Tooth Traps">Tooth Traps</a> and the kiting method. 
</li><li> Obtaining the <a href="Tam_o%27_Shanter.html" title="Tam o' Shanter">Tam o' Shanter</a> can be tricky due to the long range of <a href="MacTusk.html" title="MacTusk">MacTusk's</a> darts and the fast speed of his <a class="mw-redirect" href="Blue_Hound.html" title="Blue Hound">hounds</a> . The best approach to the group is to lure the hounds away and deal with them separately from MacTusk and his son, analyze if any healing is necessary, then going back to fight MacTusk. You may need to try several times, as the hat has merely a 25% drop rate. It is the best hat in the game to wear for regaining sanity and also helps with warmth, making it a worthy endeavour.  
</li></ul>
<p><b>​Food/Resource Tips:</b>
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="Berry_Bush.html" title="Berry Bush">Berry Bushes</a>, Grass and other renewable resources no longer respawn. Plan accordingly when you use up an area's resources!  
</li><li> If Grass is scarce, try to pick up as many as you can and use sparingly. Since the level has only winter, <a href="Log.html" title="Log">Logs</a> and Grass are needed all the time to make <a href="Campfire.html" title="Campfire">Campfires</a>. An alternative way to quickly get warm is to use a <a href="Torch.html" title="Torch">Torch</a> to burn stray trees (so it won't spread) and <a href="Manure.html" title="Manure">Manure</a> (if available). Manure can be collected and used to fuel camp fires. An great approach, if Rock is in good supply, is to build <a class="mw-redirect" href="Fire_Pit.html" title="Fire Pit">Fire Pits</a> which require no grass to build and are permanent.
</li><li> If there are Rabbits try to catch them with a <a href="Trap.html" title="Trap">Trap</a>. Use <a href="Carrot.html" title="Carrot">Carrots</a> to bait, or (preferred) 'guide' it towards the trap by placing it near the rabbit's home entrance so that it runs into the trap. 2 Rabbits and 1 twig are needed for Rabbit Earmuffs.
</li><li> If there are no Rabbits on the map, hunting for <a href="Koalefant.html" title="Koalefant">Koalefants</a> will provide 8 <a href="Meat.html" title="Meat">Meat</a> which is more <i>cost effective</i> than hunting for Beefalos. However, Koalefants are also time consuming to locate and they hit a bit harder than Beefalos. It is advisable to have <a href="Armor.html" title="Armor">Armor</a> and a <a href="Category:Ranged_Weapons.html" title="Category:Ranged Weapons">Ranged Weapon</a> when hunting.
</li><li> Try to make a <a href="Crock_Pot.html" title="Crock Pot">Crock Pot</a> as soon as possible as it is more effective to fullfil your hunger and sanity.
</li><li> Remember to collect Monster Meat since it can be used to make Pigs follow you. They can be a great help fighting against <a href="MacTusk.html" title="MacTusk">MacTusks</a> and other aggressive animals. Beware, feeding them 4 Monster Meats in total turns them into <a class="mw-redirect" href="Werepigs.html" title="Werepigs">Werepigs</a>. It is also helpful to use Monster Meat in Crock Pot recipes.

<p><i>"What? You're still here? Impressive, but you should probably stop while you're ahead."</i>
</p><p>— <i><b><a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a> greeting the player</b></i>
</p><p>Players are spawned on the ground of a <a href="Marsh.html" title="Marsh">Marsh</a> surrounded by normal <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grassland.html" title="Grassland">Grassland</a>. The player will spawn near a chest usually containing 7 <a href="Log.html" title="Log">Logs</a>, a <a href="Winter_Hat.html" title="Winter Hat">Winter Hat</a> and 3 <a href="Flint.html" title="Flint">Flint</a>.  On a rare occasion the chest may contain 10 <a href="Rot.html" title="Rot">Rot</a> and 4 random <a href="Blueprint.html" title="Blueprint">Blueprints</a>. Sometimes the Chest is spawned near a Firepit and can be ignited immediately costing The Player the items inside. Seasonal cycles are not present in this world. The world begins in winter, and will turn to endless summer after 10 days. Periodic <a href="Hound.html" title="Hound">Hound Attacks</a> begin in this world.
</p><p>The world features a resource-rich central island, surrounded by dangerous lands containing each of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="Teleportato.html" title="Teleportato">Teleportato</a> <a href="Things.html" title="Things">Things</a> . Eventually the outlying islands should be quite inhospitable. There is the possibility of an island being completely cut off from the rest of the world, requiring players to find a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Wormhole.html" title="Wormhole">Wormhole</a> to get to it.
</p><p><b>Tips:</b>
</p><p>Players will see various structures and blockades in this world. Players are advised to move quickly and be well equipped before walking through those blockades.
</p>
<ul><li> If this is your first level try to learn as many <a href="Crafting.html" title="Crafting">Recipes</a> as you need, because you will keep them through the Adventure Mode.
</li><li> It is possible to travel to <b>Archipelago</b> (Starts early summer with normal seasonal cycle) or <b>King of Winter </b>(has permanent <a href="Winter.html" title="Winter">Winter</a>). Taking with you <a href="Rabbit_Earmuff.html" title="Rabbit Earmuff">Rabbit Earmuffs</a> (worst), <a href="Winter_Hat.html" title="Winter Hat">Winter Hat</a> (okay), or <a href="Beefalo_Hat.html" title="Beefalo Hat">Beefalo Hat</a> (best) will help greatly in those levels.
</li><li> In general, this level is very easy if you know how to deal with blockades. Care should be taken in the first 10 days of winter though. 
</li><li> Blockades on the Bridges and the ways to deal with them:
<ul><li> Keep in mind that you don't have to kill everything in your way (unless you want to)
</li><li> Tier 3 <a href="Spider_Den.html" title="Spider Den">Spider Dens</a> - building 6 or more <a href="Trap.html" title="Trap">Traps</a> and luring wave after wave of <a href="Spider.html" title="Spider">Spiders</a> into it is the way to clean it. If you have just started and your area does not provide resources to make <a href="Trap.html" title="Trap">Traps</a>, you can try and run through the <a href="Spider_Den.html" title="Spider Den">Spider Dens</a> at cost of <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a>. Or, there are usually a lot of <a href="Tree.html" title="Tree">Trees</a> among the dens. You can light them with a <a href="Torch.html" title="Torch">Torch</a> and if they are near enough to the dens, both will burn, leaving the <a href="Spider.html" title="Spider">Spiders</a> to be picked off without renewing. You can also run in, plant a <a href="Pine_Cone.html" title="Pine Cone">Pine Cone</a> and wait until it is grown the next day although this results in more Spider attacks and lower <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a> . 
</li><li> <a href="Hound_Mound.html" title="Hound Mound">Hound Mounds</a> - just run away from them, because generally <a href="Hound.html" title="Hound">Hounds</a> are not fast enough to catch you.
</li><li> <a href="Tallbird_Nest.html" title="Tallbird Nest">Tallbird Nests</a> - just wait for <a class="mw-redirect" href="Dusk.html" title="Dusk">Dusk</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="Night.html" title="Night">Night</a> to run through the area, because during this time the <a href="Tallbird.html" title="Tallbird">Tallbirds</a> sleep
</li><li> <a class="mw-redirect" href="Killer_Bee_Hive.html" title="Killer Bee Hive">Killer Bee Hives</a> - wearing <a href="Beekeeper_Hat.html" title="Beekeeper Hat">Beekeeper Hat</a> will reduce 80% of incoming damage from <a class="mw-redirect" href="Killer_Bee.html" title="Killer Bee">Killer Bees</a>. If you feel that you need more protection add a <a href="Grass_Suit.html" title="Grass Suit">Grass Suit</a>(weak) or <a href="Log_Suit.html" title="Log Suit">Log Suit</a>(okay) for extra protection.
</li><li> A square of <a href="Category:Clockwork_Monsters.html" title="Category:Clockwork Monsters">Clockwork Monsters</a> - easiest way is to run through the area with Grass Suit(weak) or Log Suit(okay) and <a href="Football_Helmet.html" title="Football Helmet">Football Helmet</a>(if your map has <a href="Pig.html" title="Pig">Pigs</a> or if you manage to find a <a href="Crank_Thing.html" title="Crank Thing">Crank Thing</a> and turn the <a href="Pig.html" title="Pig">Pig</a> that will always spawn near it into a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Werepig.html" title="Werepig">Werepig</a>. The <a href="Pig_Head.html" title="Pig Head">Pig Heads</a> near a <a href="Touch_Stone.html" title="Touch Stone">Touch Stone</a> will give you up to 8 <a href="Pig_Skin.html" title="Pig Skin">Pig Skins</a>, too). Other ways to do it is to use <a href="Beefalo_Horn.html" title="Beefalo Horn">Beefalo Horn</a> and clean up with <a href="Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">Beefalos</a> or use a <a href="Spiderhat.html" title="Spiderhat">Spiderhat</a> and clean up with Spiders.
</li><li> <a class="mw-redirect" href="Swamp.html" title="Swamp">Swamp</a> blockade is the hardest, because you will have to dodge the <a href="Tentacle.html" title="Tentacle">Tentacles</a>. It's advised to have full <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a> and a Log Suit, and a Football Helmet before going into the area.
</li><li> Ideally have a lot of <a href="Healing_Salve.html" title="Healing Salve">Healing Salves</a> and/or <a href="Honey_Poultice.html" title="Honey Poultice">Honey Poultices</a> to restore <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a> to full. Getting the Healing Salve is easier, because all you have to do is trap a lot of Spiders, it's safer than running through the Swamp and picking up <a href="Reeds.html" title="Reeds">Reeds</a> and getting <a href="Honey.html" title="Honey">Honey</a>.

<p>— <i><b><a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a> greeting the player</b></i>
</p><p>Players are spawned on one of six islands. The only way to get to other islands are by <a href="Worm_Hole.html" title="Worm Hole">Worm Holes</a>.There is one <a class="mw-redirect" href="Thing.html" title="Thing">Thing</a> on each island; except on the island you begin. One island may contain one or more worm holes that split off to mulitple islands. It is likely you may need to return to the previous island(s) after collecting one piece of the Thing in order to set up the Teleportato at the <a href="Wooden_Thing.html" title="Wooden Thing">Wooden Thing</a>. 
</p><p>The season begins at the start of spring and will gradually change over time similar to sandbox mode. Each island is dominated by mostly one or two biomes. The islands are placed in a circular shape, and while the shape is no indication of the order the wormholes will travel in, each island always has the same two <a class="mw-redirect" href="Biome.html" title="Biome">biomes</a>, each time you try Archipelago.
</p><p>The starting island has a small square shaped biome full of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Carrots.html" title="Carrots">Carrots</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grass.html" title="Grass">Grass</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Saplings.html" title="Saplings">Saplings</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Berry_Bushes.html" title="Berry Bushes">Berry Bushes</a>, and the rest of the island is dominated by a massive <a class="mw-redirect" href="Swamp.html" title="Swamp">Swamp</a> filled with <a href="Spider_Den.html" title="Spider Den">Spider Dens</a>, <a href="Tentacle.html" title="Tentacle">Tentacles</a>, and <a href="Merm.html" title="Merm">Merms</a> . 
</p><p><b>Tips:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>It is suggested that the first <a href="Forest.html" title="Forest">Forest</a> biome you see you get enough <a class="mw-redirect" href="Logs.html" title="Logs">Logs</a>, <a href="Cut_Grass.html" title="Cut Grass">Cut Grass</a>, <a href="Twigs.html" title="Twigs">Twigs</a>, and <a href="Flint.html" title="Flint">Flint</a> to survive for a long while, because you won't be seeing some of the resources in the forest biome again.
</li><li>It is recommended that players establish a way to come back from or cope with <a class="mw-redirect" href="Insanity.html" title="Insanity">insanity</a>, since it is inevitable that you will be traveling via wormholes quite often.
</li><li>Usually, two of the six islands are Swamps. It can be very useful to stick around when Merms and <a href="Spider.html" title="Spider">Spiders</a> fight Tentacles, as this gives you a free grinder. If the Tentacles die, you get a weapon. If the Merms die, you get <a href="Fish.html" title="Fish">Fish</a> and <a href="Frog_Legs.html" title="Frog Legs">Frog Legs</a> which you can use to make <a class="mw-redirect" href="Fish_Sticks.html" title="Fish Sticks">Fish Sticks</a> or <a href="Meatballs.html" title="Meatballs">Meatballs</a> . If the Spiders die, you get free <a href="Silk.html" title="Silk">Silk</a> and <a href="Spider_Gland.html" title="Spider Gland">Spider Glands</a>. Just be sure that nothing tries to kill you while picking up the loot.
</li><li>Spend the first day grabbing everything you can in the starting biome, especially food and flowers. Food is scarce on the other five islands, and there is a high insanity risk too.
</li><li>Each island may have a particular set of creatures according to the biomes.
<ul><li>Starting and 2nd island: Swamp Biome has Merms, Spiders, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Mosquitoes.html" title="Mosquitoes">Mosquitoes</a> and Tentacles.
</li><li>1 island: <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grassland.html" title="Grassland">Grassland</a> /Forest Biome has <a class="mw-redirect" href="Killer_Bee_Hive.html" title="Killer Bee Hive">Killer Bee Hives</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bees.html" title="Bees">Bees</a>, Spiders.
</li><li>1 island: <a href="Rockyland.html" title="Rockyland">Rockyland</a> Biome has <a href="Tallbird.html" title="Tallbird">Tallbirds</a>.
</li><li>1 island: Rockyland/Forest Biome has Spiders and <a href="Hound_Mound.html" title="Hound Mound">Hound Mounds</a>.
</li><li>1 island: <a href="Savanna.html" title="Savanna">Savanna</a> Biome has <a href="Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">Beefalo</a>, Spiders and usually the usual creatures near the Wooden Thing.
</li></ul>
</li><li>When using the worm hole it is possible that you will travel into a middle of a field of Killer Bee Hives, Spiders, or aggressive creatures so be prepared to run to safety.
</li><li>You can destroy the hives/mounds with ranged weapons and fires, especially <a class="mw-redirect" href="Fire_Dart.html" title="Fire Dart">fire darts</a> due to the abundance of trees (<a href="Charcoal.html" title="Charcoal">Charcoal</a>) and Swamps (<a href="Reeds.html" title="Reeds">Reeds</a>). (<b>Not Advised</b> as it is time and resource consuming; the objective is to locate the Things)
</li><li>If possible, bringing a <a href="Walking_Cane.html" title="Walking Cane">Walking Cane</a> from the previous level is helpful to kite aggressive creatures, pass through swamps with tentacles, and to locate the Things. 
</li><li>If this is your fourth level, be prepared for the final stage; Darkness as it is quite difficult.

<p><i>"Say. pal. Let's make a deal. You can stay here. Settle down, even. I'll give you food, gold, pigs, whatever you need. All I want in return is a truce."</i>
</p><p>— <i><b><a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a> greeting the player</b></i>
</p><p>The character awakens on a ground of <a href="Wooden_Flooring.html" title="Wooden Flooring">Wooden Flooring</a> surrounded by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Fire_Pit.html" title="Fire Pit">Fire Pit</a>, a <a href="Tent.html" title="Tent">Tent</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Trees.html" title="Trees">Trees</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Berry_Bushes.html" title="Berry Bushes">Berry Bushes</a>, and <a href="Carrot.html" title="Carrot">Carrots</a>. Maxwell materializes to ask the player for a truce, provided you stay there. Seven out of eight minutes are daylight on the large mainland where you start. In addition, there are no <a href="Things.html" title="Things">Things</a> on this land.
</p><p>In order to locate the Things you must travel through <a href="Worm_Hole.html" title="Worm Hole">Worm Holes</a> that connects the mainland to the secondary land. There are two types of <a href="Worm_Hole.html" title="Worm Hole">Worm Hole</a>; One is the normal Worm Hole you encounter in sandbox mode, and the other is <a class="mw-redirect" href="Sick_Worm_Hole#Sick_Worm_Holes.html" title="Sick Worm Hole">Sick Worm Hole</a> that can only be used for a one way trip.
</p><p>When on the secondary island, certain parts of the <a href="Biomes.html" title="Biomes">biomes</a> will cause the day/night cycle to turn from 7 out of 8 minutes day to a more normal cycle, about 3–4 minutes daylight out of 8. (E.g. When walking/traveling through worm hole from a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grassland.html" title="Grassland">grassland</a> to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Swamp.html" title="Swamp">swamp</a> biome will cause the time shift). Take care of the time when travelling between biomes as the time change may make it dark faster than you expect.
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><b>Tips:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>The mainland should have plenty of food and since daylight is much longer, respawn rates from berry bushes and other plants are faster. 
</li><li>The secondary island has a range of aggressive creatures. Take caution.
</li><li>If this world appeared on chapter 3, it is recommended that you bring winter gear with you to the next world, as it is possible for 'The Game is Afoot' or 'King of Winter' to appear in chapter 4 if they haven't appeared before.
</li></ul>
<ul><li>If this world appeared on chapter 4, it is recommended that you bring a stack of fireflies (for <a href="Miner_Hat.html" title="Miner Hat">Miner Hat</a>) and a lot of food (<a href="Jerky.html" title="Jerky">Jerky</a> or <a href="Honey.html" title="Honey">Honey</a>  because of long-term storage), as the next world will be in permanent night and scarce on food.

</p><p>— <i><b><a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a> greeting the player</b></i>
</p><p>Chapter 5 has several modifiers making it the end of the journey for all but the most well-prepared players. You spawn with a bunch of <a href="Campfire.html" title="Campfire">campfires</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Fire_pit.html" title="Fire pit">fire pits</a> surrounding you and there will be a <a href="Backpack.html" title="Backpack">backpack</a> nearby which has schematics for the <a href="Miner_Hat.html" title="Miner Hat">Miner Hat</a>, a healthy stack of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grass.html" title="Grass">grass</a>, a stack of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Logs.html" title="Logs">logs</a>, two random items, and an extra random <a href="Blueprint.html" title="Blueprint">blueprint</a> .The level's Day-night cycle has only permanent night, thus players have to survive and find the <a href="Things.html" title="Things">Things</a> in complete darkness. Since there is no day light, most creatures are asleep, crops won't grow and other plants may take longer to replenish themselves, and most importantly, your sanity continuously declines over time. To make things worse, due to chronic low sanity, building life-saving camp fires will often attract <a class="mw-redirect" href="Hallucination#Night_Hand.html" title="Hallucination">Night Hands</a> that will attempt to put out the light (note: they also decrease sanity when you are near them).
</p><p>There are almost no food resources for you to collect and your only source of natural light is <a href="Maxwell%27s_Light.html" title="Maxwell's Light">Maxwell's Lights</a> scattered around the map. Now those might sound like a lot but they're really not going to help you much if you didn't come prepared yourself. The map is a linear progression where each <a class="mw-redirect" href="Biome.html" title="Biome">Biomes</a> are connected by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bridges.html" title="Bridges">bridge</a>  (slightly similar to the ones in "King of Winter") that might be blocked by <a class="mw-redirect" href="Boulders.html" title="Boulders">Boulders</a> ; make sure you have a <a href="Pickaxe.html" title="Pickaxe">Pickaxe</a> or <a href="Gunpowder.html" title="Gunpowder">gunpowder</a> ready to blow through them. There is a chance that the bridge might be blocked by <a href="Obelisk.html" title="Obelisk">Obelisks</a>. Each area has a Thing so make sure you find it before moving onto the next Biome. 
</p><p>There are <a class="mw-redirect" href="Pigs.html" title="Pigs">Pigs</a> sleeping on the map which you can kill for meat, however with their kiting A.I. they can be a bit tricky. There is a chance you will find <a href="Tallbird.html" title="Tallbird">Tallbirds</a> in this map which are in your best interest to try and kill if you are comfortable dodging their attacks, especially if they have laid an <a href="Tallbird_Egg.html" title="Tallbird Egg">egg</a> . <a href="Koalefant.html" title="Koalefant">Koalefant</a> is also quite worth it. There are Maxwell Lights positioned around the map that turn on when you get near them; use them as an opportunity to take out the Divining Rod to see if you're getting closer to the pieces. Cooking <a href="Mushrooms.html" title="Mushrooms">Mushrooms</a> along the way can prevent you from becoming insane e.g. <a class="mw-redirect" href="Cooked_Blue_Cap.html" title="Cooked Blue Cap">Cooked Blue Caps</a> that restores sanity. However, note the dual uses of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Blue_Mushroom.html" title="Blue Mushroom">Blue Mushroom</a> which can be eaten raw to replenish hunger and health at the expense of sanity which can be a life saver in certain situations.
</p><p><b>Tips</b>:
</p>
<ul><li>In order to build a Miner Hat it is HIGHLY recommended that you unlocked the <a href="Bug_Net.html" title="Bug Net">Bug Net</a>  from the previous level so you can catch <a href="Fireflies.html" title="Fireflies">Fireflies</a> . This will save grass and twigs from making torches. Bringing a stack of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Gold.html" title="Gold">gold</a> from the previous level is helpful. The greater light radius provided by the Miner Hat can be critical to survival when traveling through <a href="Maxwell%27s_Tooth_Trap.html" title="Maxwell's Tooth Trap">Tooth Trap</a> fields and <a href="Hound_Mound.html" title="Hound Mound">Hound Mound</a> areas. 
</li><li>Only build camp fires to cook your food, but you must hurry as Night Hands would put it out. I don't advise stopping them as they will continuously attack the fire (due to <span style="line-height:21px;">permanent darkenss) </span>and also decreases your sanity(just put on the <a href="Miner_Hat.html" title="Miner Hat">Miner's Hat</a> and walk towards them constantly until they vanish). 
</li><li>You may need to build a Log Suit while traveling through the <a class="mw-redirect" href="Swamp.html" title="Swamp">Swamp</a> Biomes as the darkness makes it difficult to navigate and avoid <a class="mw-redirect" href="Tentacles.html" title="Tentacles">tentacles</a>. This means sacrificing your backpack.
</li><li><span style="line-height:21px;"> If you haven't found any of these food sources and you're getting desperate for food, you're going to have to resort to <a class="mw-redirect" href="Spiders.html" title="Spiders">Spiders</a> . <a class="mw-redirect" href="Cooked_Monster_Meat.html" title="Cooked Monster Meat">Cooked Monster Meat</a> can be a life saver at the expense of sanity. </span>
</li><li><span style="line-height:21px;">Suggested items to bring over from previous level:</span>
</li></ul>
<ul><li><ol><li><span style="line-height:21px;">A stack of gold to facilitate making the </span><a href="Miner_Hat.html" title="Miner Hat">Miner's Hats</a>.
</li><li><span style="line-height:21px;">A <a href="Walking_Cane.html" title="Walking Cane">Walking Cane</a> to kite and travel faster</span>.
</li><li><span style="line-height:21px;">A stack of <a href="Jerky.html" title="Jerky">Jerky</a> or other long-lasting food supply that also restores health.</span>
</li><li><span style="line-height:21px;">Spider <a href="Silk.html" title="Silk">Silk</a> for catching Fireflies with Bug Nets and <a href="Top_Hat.html" title="Top Hat">Top Hats</a> or a <a href="Tam_o%27_Shanter.html" title="Tam o' Shanter">Tam o' Shanter</a> (highly recommended) to use when standing near stationary light sources; or pre-captured stack of Fireflies </span><span style="line-height:21px;">for Miner Hats, or something else of your choosing. </span>
</li></ol>

<i>"Well, this is it. You found me. Now, what are you going to do?"</i>
</p><p>— <i><b><a href="Maxwell_(NPC).html" title="Maxwell (NPC)">Maxwell</a> meeting the player</b></i>
</p><p>This is the last level and the player has reached Maxwell's Island – a small labyrinth leading to Maxwell's hall.
</p><p>Epilogue is a dark and dead wasteland, with a hallway in the center leading to the <a href="Nightmare_Throne.html" title="Nightmare Throne">Nightmare Throne</a>. The hallway branches of into small areas containing resources. The first area contains 4 <a class="mw-redirect" href="Chests.html" title="Chests">chests</a> full with supplies, in the second area there is some <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grass.html" title="Grass">grass</a> and <a href="Berry_Bush.html" title="Berry Bush">berry bushes</a> (most are barren), the third area has 3 the <a href="Category:Crafting_Stations.html" title="Category:Crafting Stations">crafting stations</a> used for prototyping, and the last area has 3 <a class="mw-redirect" href="Crock_pot.html" title="Crock pot">crock pots</a> and some mixed food laying on the ground next to them. There is permanent night and <a href="Maxwell%27s_Light.html" title="Maxwell's Light">Maxwell's Lights</a> are showing your way. No matter what level your sanity may be, eyes can be seen in the darkness. Out in the wastelands is a fully assembled <a class="mw-redirect" href="Teleportato.html" title="Teleportato">Teleportato</a> that, when used teleports the player to the Nightmare Throne.
</p><p>At the end of the road, players will reach Maxwell's Hall. A deformed Maxwell is sitting in a large chair with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Phonograph.html" title="Phonograph">phonograph</a> nearby playing music (if you turn it off, Maxwell will thank you). When meeting Maxwell, he will start talking, telling the player that when he got here there was nothing but dust, and "them" and that he doesn't know what they want, that they are just watching. If the player attacks Maxwell, then the throne protects him(a lightning will strike you and no matter what weapon you are holding,it will vanish), and Maxwell tells the player that the throne will not allow it. He also tells you that he has been around here for a long time, and that the player can stay around and keep him company, or to put the key in the box.
</p><p>Next to the throne is the Nightmare Lock where the <a href="Divining_Rod.html" title="Divining Rod">Divining Rod</a> can be placed. If the Divining Rod is put in the lock, the game will ask you if you want to take pity on Maxwell but also that his captors would not be happy about it. When Maxwell is freed from the throne, he gets up and instantly dies, then turns to dust and fade away. Your character is grabbed by Shadow Hands and is placed on the throne, effectively taking Maxwell's place and becoming the new pawn (and turning the phonograph on again, if the player had turned it off before). After that you will get the final speech from Klei, and then be brought back to your sandbox game...as Maxwell! Congratulations! You have beaten Adventure Mode!
</p><p><b>Note</b>: If you beat Adventure World as Maxwell, the person you completed the game with last will be sitting in the chair, still doing the terrified animation. Unlocking the lock will kill them, and put Maxwell back in the chair. You will wake up in your world as that person.
</p><p><b>Note</b>:There will still be Periodic Hound Attacks in this level !!!
</p><p><b>Easter egg</b>: Far behind(in the left side) the Nightmare throne is a graveyard, with an Eyebone and a Miner Hat next to a skeleton. On the graves are the names of the developers of the game, one example being Kevin Forbes. Caution is advised if the graves are dug up, as ghosts have a 100% chance to spawn from them.
</p><p><b>Easter egg</b>: Randomly placed somewhere on the map, there is an island made of 2-3 tiles, on which there is a Teleportato as well as the 4 pieces. This island cannot be reached or "mapped" without the use of cheats. and when this Teleportato is used it teleports you back to the nightmare throne and a second deformed Maxwell will spawn(not on the throne) and say "Don't you think I've tried that?" then disappear.
</p><p><b>Easter egg:</b> If you use the console to reveal the minimap fog, an island will be visible that is completely barren save for the underlaying grass turf. This island may be a sandbox, allowing the player to use the console to spawn or build anything they like without any of the normal world distractions like the day/night cycle, weather, mobs, etc.
