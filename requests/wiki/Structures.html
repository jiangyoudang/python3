<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p>This category lists the various<b> Structures</b> are either crafted in-game, or sometimes found around the world. Structures are special objects that serve a passive purpose such as using a wall to defend or blockade an area, or an active purpose, such as a <a href="Houndius_Shootius.html" title="Houndius Shootius">Houndius Shootius</a> being used to protect an area against mobs.

<b>Structure Radius</b>
</p><p>When placed, every structure or plantable has a radius.
</p><p>If anything already exists within that radius, it can't be placed there. It doesn't take into account what's already there; it only counts the radius of the object being placed. (This is why, for example, you can place a chest very close to an existing birdcage, but if you try to place a birdcage next to an existing chest, you need to place it significantly further away.)The following are the radius values from the LUA files:

<p><i>Note on Plantables vs Structures:</i> For the purposes of the table above, if you can build it and it goes into your inventory, it's a plantable. If you can pre-build it and place it later, it's a structure.
</p><p>If looking to build stuff tightly together, you need to place the large items first. (For example, build the birdcage first, <i>then</i> the walls around it, not the other way around. Build the crockpot, <i>then</i> the chests and so forth.)
</p><p><i>Note on Architectural Geometry</i>: if you're running this mod, by default, snap is 0.5 units. That means you can build stuff "as close to the planned wall as possible" by hovering over the ground where the wall will go, then moving 2 clicks diagonally away, and building. When you build the wall, it will be 1 unit away, the closest it can be from the drying rack/crock pot/bird cage/etc.
