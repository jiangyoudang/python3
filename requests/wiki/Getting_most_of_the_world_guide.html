This is my first guide in here, and its about getting big parts of the worlds.</p>
<nav class="toc" id="toc"><div id="toctitle"><h2>Contents</h2><span class="toctoggle">[<a class="internal" data-hide="hide" data-show="show" href="#.html" id="togglelink">show</a>]</span></div><ol></ol></nav>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Base_camp">Base camp</span></h2>
<p>This is about to become the main part of the world. Make a base camp where you would like it to be. You can read the base camp guide for more help.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Travelling">Travelling</span></h2>
<p>As written in the base camp guide, set up your base camp near the road. It's good to be cobblestone, since this will lead you to pig villages, one of which can be with the king pig, which makes the gold infinite source. Other way is to settle near wormhole, which is good way to explore to most parts of the world. If you have the summons mod by heavenfall, you can craft chaotic wormholes to explore. Also trails are not bad.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Farmings">Farmings</span></h2>
<p>Each part of the world can be used to do different farms and things. For example, if you find some tallbird nests, you can use this to farm tallbird eggs. Make sure to make ways to these places.
</p><p>You can also farm rabbits, by placing a lot of traps near rabbit holes.
</p><p>This is very useful for the first couple winters, as live rabbits don't spoil (unless <i><a href="Reign_of_Giants.html" title="Reign of Giants">Reign of Giants</a></i> is enabled) and can be used for meatballs and other Crock Pot foods.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Using_natural_ways_for_your_own">Using natural ways for your own</span></h2>
<p>You can use trails as natural way, and make cobblestone patches if you can find good things there. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manures.2C_silk.2C_grass.2C_MATERIALS.21">Manures, silk, grass, MATERIALS!</span></h2>
<p>Use good places to make spider farms, beefalo pens, panic rooms, vegetable farms, grass, sapling and berry bushes gardens, smalll forests and so on. Make small camps (not big) on each place to have place to sleep if night is coming and you don't have enough time to return to your base.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Spider_farms">Spider farms</span></h3>
<p>Destroy spider dens and if you find spider queens. Gather spider eggs. Find a nice place to plant 4-5 nests. Build pig houses if you can(playing as Wendy is good since you can order Abigail to deal with the spiders). Then the pigs will attack the spiders so every time you come, you can find spider loot or pig loot if the spiders kill the pigs. The monster meat will be eaten by the pigs, which could turn them into were-pigs, but you can find a way to gather downwards. Also 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beefalo_pens">Beefalo pens</span></h3>
<p>Kill beefalos when you find until you get beefalo horn(this can take some time). You should build a pen in a nice place where to lead the found beefalos when you play the horn. Then leave the beefalos. Each time you come here there will be manure for you. Also having miner hat during  the night when beefalos sleep will be good for gathering beefalo wool. Craft yourself beefalo hats or avoid coming here during the beefalo mating season.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Gardens">Gardens</span></h3>
<p>Find three good places. Collect some saplings, berry bushes and grass tufts. You should collect some manure from your beefalo pens before proceeding. Then plant the grass tufts on the place you selected for them, same for berry bushes and saplings. Bring with you some tooth traps to set around the berry bushes to kill gobblers easy. Now you can collect grass, saplings and berries within couple of days.
