<div class="mw-content-ltr" dir="ltr" id="mw-content-text" lang="en"><p><b>Seasons</b> are points of the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="Don%27t_Starve.html" title="Don't Starve">Don't Starve</a></i> year in which the environment changes, changing the gameplay.
</p><p>In <a href="Sandbox_Mode.html" title="Sandbox Mode">Sandbox Mode</a>, if you don't customize your world, the first <a href="Winter.html" title="Winter">Winter</a> will begin on day 21 and end on day 36 (16 days total). The seasons should then keep alternating between 20 day Summers and 16 day Winters (next winter on day 57, etc.).
</p><p>For customization:
</p>
<ul><li> A long season lasts around 50 days
</li><li> A short season lasts around 10 days
</li></ul>
<p>During <a href="Summer.html" title="Summer">Summer</a>, the <a href="Day-Night_Cycle.html" title="Day-Night Cycle">days</a> are longer, crops grow, and <a href="Food.html" title="Food">Food</a> is easier to find.
</p><p>In Winter, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Night.html" title="Night">Nights</a> are longer and the player must stay warm to avoid <a href="Freezing.html" title="Freezing">Freezing</a> to death. Plants stop growing and many creatures stop being active, while some new others will come out.
</p><p>Winter is a difficult challenge, and players should prepare for it during the Summer by stocking up on resources and making sure they will have sources of heat, Food and <a href="Health.html" title="Health">Health</a> as well as the means to defend themselves from <a href="Monsters.html" title="Monsters">Monsters</a>.

<p>In the <i><a href="Reign_of_Giants.html" title="Reign of Giants">Reign of Giants</a></i> DLC, the seasons are changed dramatically.
</p><p>There are now four seasons, <a href="Autumn.html" title="Autumn">Autumn</a>, Winter, <a href="Spring.html" title="Spring">Spring</a>, and Summer, which cycle through to make a full year. <a href="Winter.html" title="Winter">Winter</a> is largely the same, albeit with changes to <a href="Deerclops.html" title="Deerclops">Deerclops</a> that make survival more difficult. Autumn, for all intents and purposes, is the old Summer, which makes Autumn the safest season of the year, and a new Summer has been added, in which the player can now be susceptible to <a href="Overheating.html" title="Overheating">Overheating</a>, the high-temperature equivalent to Freezing. In Spring, there is no Freezing or Overheating from the environment, but it will <a href="Rain.html" title="Rain">Rain</a> excessively, which can put out fires and will now cause <a href="Wetness.html" title="Wetness">Wetness</a>, which will lead to Freezing if it continues too much. Also, <a href="Rabbit.html" title="Rabbit">Rabbit</a> holes will close, forcing you to switch food sources from winter, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bees.html" title="Bees">Bees</a> will turn <a class="mw-redirect" href="Killer_Bees.html" title="Killer Bees">red</a> and go hostile, making Spring still a challenge, albeit not the most dangerous one.
</p><p>Spring and Autumn are considered "safe" seasons in the game, in comparison to Summer and Winter, which are considered "dangerous". Because of this, when starting a new game, it will randomly place you in either Spring or Autumn without changing world setting. The "safe" seasons are also longer, being 20 days each, whereas the "dangerous" seasons are only 16 days. This makes a full year in-game 72 days long.

<p>Each season now has its own "Giant", or boss mob, that spawns sometime during the respective season. Winter retains the <a href="Deerclops.html" title="Deerclops">Deerclops</a>, but now there is the <a href="Bearger.html" title="Bearger">Bearger</a> in Autumn, the <a href="Dragonfly.html" title="Dragonfly">Dragonfly</a> in Summer, and the <a href="Goose.html" title="Moose/Goose">Moose/Goose</a> in Spring. Each giant will drop a material needed to craft an item that can be used to better survive the hazards of the following season, with the exception of the Dragonfly, as being before Autumn (the season with no special hazard), will instead drop a material to craft an item used for combat.
