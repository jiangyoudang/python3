<p>So you wish to hatch a smallbird? Do you fail everytime? Do you forget to grab it when it is heating? Then this guide is for you.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hatching_the_egg.">Hatching the egg.</span></h2>
<p>This is simple, yet people often fail. What must you do? First, find the tallbird nest. The nest can be empty, or with an egg in it. If it is empty, wait 2 days and the tallbird will lay an egg. The photo containts nests, eggs and 2 smallbirds. 
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Stealing an egg with no armour can be difficult, as the tallbird will chase you for 2 screens. Fight it and get 2 meats if you are hungry or simply run away until it tires.
</p>
<figure class="article-thumb tright" style="width: 180px"> <a class="image" href="File:WX_with_two_Smallbirds.jpg.html"><img alt="WX with two Smallbirds" class="thumbimage" data-image-key="WX_with_two_Smallbirds.jpg" data-image-name="WX with two Smallbirds.jpg" height="101" src="img/180px-WX_with_two_Smallbirds.jpg" width="180"/></a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>
<p><br/>
</p><p>So, you stole the egg. Now, drop it by a fire pit. Make sure there is no fire in the day. It can hatch, but it will die from melting.
</p><p>BOOM the egg is hatching. But, it won't be that fast.You must collect as much berries and seeds to setup. It is not recommended to hatch an egg/eggs during the winter unless you have a good amount of seeds and berries.
</p><p>You must take care of the eggs; like preventing pigs from eating the egg.
</p><p>Make sure it is near a fire during night, or it will explode into wet goop. Make sure it is not near a fire during the day, or it will turn into a cooked morsel.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Smallbird">Smallbird</span></h2>
<p>This cycle can be dangerous in these 10 days because hounds may attack and hurt smallbirds.
</p><p>You must also feed smallbirds food or if you do not they will starve.
</p><p>I prefer on my day 106, not to use a panic room as I use pig houses and bunnymen houses. They are good as long as the Bunnymen don't murder you for meat. Or if you get attacked by bunnymen or pigs, smallbirds are practically dead.
</p><p>But nothing is lost! When smallbirds emit a battle cry (chirping) you can quickly kill the provoker and save the birds. This happened to me but with fast reactions I survived. Once this hard cycle is done I can show you a picture for my pig houses and rabbit hutches.

<figure class="article-thumb tright" style="width: 180px"> <a class="image" href="File:Smallbird_safety.jpg.html"><img alt="Smallbird safety" class="thumbimage" data-image-key="Smallbird_safety.jpg" data-image-name="Smallbird safety.jpg" height="101" src="img/180px-Smallbird_safety.jpg" width="180"/></a> <figcaption> <p class="caption">safety precautions</p> </figcaption> </figure>
<p> Also, don't take on trips during these days!
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Smallish_Tallbird">Smallish Tallbird</span></h2>
<p>When Smallbird cycle is over, Smallbirds grow into Teen smallbirds (or smallish tallbirds officially.)
</p><p><br/>
This cycle can be safer, but after 18 days you have to say goodbye.Bbut not yet.
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>With teen birds you can take on trips now, but not in caves, so don't go in caves yet,
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>Beware of hounds! My teen birds died on hound attacks, but I managed to camp all these days and grow a tallbird, I put it into cage and it escaped. You can try getting them again and again until they get trapped.
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>I hope this guide helped. I will post more pictures as soon as I have more time to get more of them.
