These are standards on how articles on the Don't Starve Wiki should be made.
</p>
<nav class="toc" id="toc"><div id="toctitle"><h2>Contents</h2><span class="toctoggle">[<a class="internal" data-hide="hide" data-show="show" href="#.html" id="togglelink">show</a>]</span></div><ol></ol></nav>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Editing">General Editing</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_the_Edit_Summary">Use the Edit Summary</span></h3>
<p>When editing pages, try to fill in the "Summary" box above the Save/Preview buttons before saving, and make sure that you fill it in with something useful describing the edit you made and, if it's not obvious, why. For example, "fixed spelling error" or "added fun fact" or "reverted edits by 127.0.0.1" are all acceptable. Saying "made some changes" or just filling in the name of the page is not helpful, because it's information that we already have. Making your Summaries accurate and useful makes it vastly easier for the rest of us to keep track of Recent Changes and keeps everybody happy.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Use_the_Minor_Edit_Button">Use the Minor Edit Button</span></h3>
<p>If you're making a minor edit (e.g. fixing a spelling error or tweaking formatting), try to remember to check the "This is a minor edit" button below the Summary box before saving the page. Again, this will make things easier for the rest of us.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Link_Once">Link Once</span></h3>
<p>A given page should only contain one link to any other page. If a page links to <a href="Pig.html" title="Pig">Pig</a> in one place, then that should be the only link to Pig on that page. Typically this link should be the first instance of the term in the article. But in the case of large articles, it's also okay to instead make one link in each major section instead of just once.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Don.27t_use_conversational_style">Don't use conversational style</span></h3>
<p>This is an online encyclopedia. It should read like an encyclopedia, not like your diary.
</p>
<ul><li>Check your spelling and grammar. Don't use internet slang (ex. "How r u?" or "c u 2nite"). If you're not 100% sure about the way a word is spelled, type it into <a class="external text exitstitial" href=".html" rel="nofollow">Webster</a>. If you know that you're not the strongest speller, compose your edits in a word processor or web browser which has spell-checking (Firefox 2 and derivatives such as Opera when ASpell is installed will work).
</li><li>Don't use "smileys" or "emoticons" in articles.
</li><li>Don't "reply" to content others have posted. If you think a particular point warrants discussion, post on the article's Discussion page. If you're 100% sure that something should be changed and don't think a discussion is necessary, just change it. Dialogue goes only on articles' Discussion pages.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Quotes">Quotes</span></h3>
<ul><li>Please discuss changing character quotes without rhyme or reason, as some people have different opinions on which should be used. If the quote is out of date, or you're completely sure that the old quote doesn't fit the article, feel free to change it.  
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Infobloat">Infobloat</span></h3>
<ul><li>Avoid pointless infobox cluttering. The infobox about basic info, full info is the main body of the article.
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Stubs">Stubs</span></h3>
<p>If you don't know enough information on a topic, an article is far too short, or you know there's more, then add a stub to it. To do so, just add this to the bottom of the content (a clear line above the [[Category:...]] tags):
</p>
<pre>  <a href="Template:Stub.html" title="Template:Stub">{{Stub}}</a>
</pre>
<p>and people will know that it's a stub by looking at the stub category.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Talk_page_etiquette">Talk page etiquette</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Do">Do</span></h3>
<ul><li>Sign your posts with four tildes ~~~~
</li><li>Add unsigned to user posts that have forgotten to sign
</li><li>Be polite, assume good faith
</li><li>Add new headers for each new conversation
</li></ul>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Don.27t">Don't</span></h3>
<ul><li>Edit other peoples posts (Removing rule breaking content is allowed)
</li><li>Be brash and rude.
</li><li>Add absurdly complex and over-the-top signatures.
</li></ul>
