<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Notes_about_this_Guide_from_the_original_Creator">Notes about this Guide from the original Creator</span></h2>
<p>Before I begin, I have to say I absolutely love <i>Don't Starve</i>!
</p><p>I was introduced to this game by FORCE Strategy Gaming channel on YouTube - made the purchase and played so much of it I would like to think that I'm qualified enough to write a survival guide here.
</p><p>I'd love to write more on the nitty gritty everyday survival strategies but I have not got the time.
</p><p>All comments are welcome and cheers.
</p><p>Although this article is focused on survival with WX-78, here are my thoughts on each of the characters:
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characters">Characters</span></h2>
<p><a href="Wilson.html" title="Wilson">Wilson</a> - This is probably my second most favourite character. I like the fact that he survives <a href="Winter.html" title="Winter">winter</a> easily and has no trouble stocking up on <a class="mw-redirect" href="Meat_Effigies.html" title="Meat Effigies">Meat Effigies</a>. I also like that his <a href="Beard.html" title="Beard">beard</a> stays with him when using <a class="mw-redirect" href="Teleportato.html" title="Teleportato">Teleportatos</a> and in <a href="Adventure_Mode.html" title="Adventure Mode">Adventure Mode</a>.
</p><p><a href="Willow.html" title="Willow">Willow </a> - I don't like Willow as much, mostly because her abilities are not worth the downsides in long term survival. Her <a href="Willow%27s_Lighter.html" title="Willow's Lighter">lighter</a> gives her infinite <a class="mw-redirect" href="Light.html" title="Light">light</a>, but veteran players usually solve light problems by day 5. I think she will likely be much more viable if an update provides more benefits. She is also immune to fire damage, which might be useful considering the <a href="Reign_of_Giants.html" title="Reign of Giants">Reign of Giants</a> <a href="Summer.html" title="Summer">Summer</a>.
</p><p><a href="Wolfgang.html" title="Wolfgang">Wolfgang </a> - I used to like him a lot before the <a class="mw-redirect" href="Updates.html" title="Updates">major character update</a>, but now he is afraid of the dark and <a href="Monsters.html" title="Monsters">monsters</a>. That's terrible considering other characters. My playstyle focuses heavily on caves and <a href="Ruins.html" title="Ruins">ruin</a> spelunking and Wolfgang is just not that great there. I rarely use him.
</p><p><a href="Wendy.html" title="Wendy">Wendy </a> - Another character I personally don't like too much. I'd like to think most veterans don't like her because <a href="Abigail.html" title="Abigail">Abigail </a> gets in the way with a lot of stuff. I also personally think Abigail is a <a href="Character_guides-Wendy.html" title="Guides/Character guides-Wendy">little frail</a>. But the worst problem in my opinion is the fact that Wendy cannot kill most mobs with a single hit using a <a href="Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a>.
</p><p><a href="WX-78.html" title="WX-78">WX-78</a> - My personal favourite. He starts off with 100 Sanity, Hunger and Health, but once you get a decent foothold he is quite powerful. And there's a way to play this character that's pretty cool, that's what my guide is going to be focused on. I also like that WX-78 can complete Adventure Mode much faster if played well. I will discuss this further (and how to hunt that elusive <a href="Wes.html" title="Wes">Wes</a> EASILY with WX-78).
</p><p><a href="Wickerbottom.html" title="Wickerbottom">Wickerbottom </a> - Fun character, I use her often too. I personally just dislike that she is no good with <a class="mw-redirect" href="Spoilage.html" title="Spoilage">spoilage</a> which is a huge bummer in Caves and Ruins.
</p><p><a href="Woodie.html" title="Woodie">Woodie </a> - At first I thought Woodie was too overpowered to play fairly. He kills anything easily in his <a class="mw-redirect" href="WereBeaver.html" title="WereBeaver">WereBeaver form</a> and he can easily get tons of materials to build his world in this form. But I dislike the fact that I cannot have complete control over this form. Expect to transform at the worst possible moment (when you don't wish to) because he does that every full moon. Sure you can plan for it but it's still a problem. Other than that, he's really quite a powerful character. 
<a href="Wes.html" title="Wes">Wes</a> - Wes has only two benefits. <a class="mw-redirect" href="Balloons.html" title="Balloons">Balloons</a> and taming <a href="Catcoon.html" title="Catcoon">Catcoon</a> early.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Why_I_like_using_WX-78">Why I like using WX-78</span></h2>
<ul><li>WX-78 is unaffected with spoilage. This means even eating an almost rotten <a href="Jerky.html" title="Jerky">Jerky</a> still gives WX-78 full benefits, including Sanity increase. I cannot begin to say how important this is when spelunking. You can go on twice as long as most other characters. When played correctly, WX-78 can survive <a href="Caves.html" title="Caves">underground </a> for a very long time.
</li><li>WX-78 upgrades with <a href="Gears.html" title="Gears">Gears</a>. With the maximum amount of gear upgrades, WX-78 has 300 Sanity, 400 Health and 200 Hunger. WX-78 can survive underground (or anywhere!) very long. And it gets almost impossible to kill WX-78 even if WX-78 is not wearing any armor. WX-78 is a very respected late game character by most veterans.
</li><li>WX-78 can get stuck by lightning and benefit from it. You can almost disregard the rain damage. The damage is low and USUALLY during rain, WX-78 is quite likely to get hit at least once by lightning. Getting hit like this heals him (mitigating the rain damage) and gives you an increase in speed. Plus, WX-78 gets a light aura which can prevent freezing and Charlie attacks. This ability makes WX-78 quite a powerful character in quick early game exploration and foraging.
</li><li>While WX-78 is well equipped with benefits, some might find it not easy to play in the sense that WX-78 starts off with weak statistics. So you have to be very careful with WX-78 in the early game before getting a bunch of gears.
</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Gameplan">Gameplan</span></h2>
<p>The creators of <i>Don't Starve</i> have always encouraged players to have their own end goals. The game itself is open ended and does not exactly have a way to 'complete' it unless you're counting Adventure Mode. But mostly its just how you as the player decide what your end goals are. 
</p><p>While surviving indefinitely is ok - the real fun (in my twisted version at least) is to try and discover and build Ancient artifacts, to kill the Ancient Guardian, and to get out of that world before Day 200 when things start to go crazy by using the Teleportato. Once the character has escaped, you get to start a new game (Day 1) with ALL your inventory items intact from the last game! Always continue to use WX-78, he keeps all of his health/sanity/hunger upgrades INTACT which makes subsequent games incredibly easier.
</p><p>With this, you can go spelunking again, kill the Ancient again and basically try to amass a number of Houndius Shootius to be used in your FINAL FINAL BASE WORLD (the one that you will stay with indefinitely and use the acumulated Houndius Shootius to safeguard against those pesky hound attacks easily!) I see a number of people in forums complaining that Ancient Guardian should respawn... well he does respawn if you Teleportato out to the next world. 
</p><p>OK. In order to survive indefinitely, remember that you have to keep jumping to the next world before the day count gets too high. This is because it simply gets too tedious having to deal with 6 Depth Worms or 12 Hounds twice every week!! So you must Teleportato out of there before...say, day 150. Try not to exceed Day 200. This means you are playing against time which is also cool as a gameplay mechanic. Think Battlestar Galactica where they have to keep warping away from Cylon attacks every hour or so. So you need to get your shit in order fast, go spelunking, kill the Ancient, build everything you need, find the 4 Thingies, locate Teleportato - and zap to the next world. Wash rinse repeat to accumulate Houndius Shootius and then finally build an impenetrable defence in your LAST world of your choosing (pls choose one with awesome layout of cuz) - and consider it the Alamo.
</p><p>Yes. This undertaking is a HUGE feat. 
</p><p>I have not done it 100% yet but I am on my 3rd world with 2 houndius and still going strong. Mostly because its quite impossible for a 400 Health WX to die even in dire situations.
</p><p>I don't have time to write more now but I will be back to write more on what you should do in your first world and more obscure tips and tricks. But below is a very quick and general guideline: 
</p><p>The first world is where I just try to get everything set up for the 2nd world. I may not even decide to go for the Ancient Guardian in the 1st world. Basically just get all basic necessities, lots of food, materials, pre-build EVERYTHING possible in the build panel WITHOUT placing them (Birdcage is KEY, make sure that is done). Where you build your base in 1st world is not too important since we won't be staying here long. Then Teleportato over to the 2nd world and set up a MAIN BASE of operation right at the CAVE entrance. Because the 2nd world is where spelunking gets totally serious! Try to choose cave entrances that are nearer to stuff like <a class="mw-redirect" href="Beefalos.html" title="Beefalos">Beefalos</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="Ponds.html" title="Ponds">Ponds</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="Hive.html" title="Hive">Hives</a> or something nice.
