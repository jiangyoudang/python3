<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Farming.C2.A0">Farming </span></h2>
<p>This guide is made for farming <a class="mw-redirect" href="Saplings.html" title="Saplings">saplings</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grass_Tufts.html" title="Grass Tufts">grass tufts</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Berry_Bushes.html" title="Berry Bushes">berry bushes</a>.It will teach you farming techniques from day 1 to 4 and onwards.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Saplings.2C_Grass_Tufts.2C_Berry_Bushes_and_Pine_cones.">Saplings, Grass Tufts, Berry Bushes and Pine cones.</span></h2>
<p>Saplings, grass, trees, and berry bushes are found in <a href="Grasslands.html" title="Grasslands">grasslands</a>. In every biome (except  <a href="Rockyland.html" title="Rockyland">rockyland</a>) everything important for survival will be in any <a class="mw-redirect" href="Biome.html" title="Biome">biome</a>, it includes <a href="Mosaic.html" title="Mosaic">mosaic</a> biome, <a href="Savanna.html" title="Savanna">savanna</a> biome, <a href="Forest.html" title="Forest">forest</a> biome (living here is not recommended but abundance of trees and mass exploring can lead for large amount of <a href="Pine_Cone.html" title="Pine Cone">pine cones</a> as long you don't run out of <a href="Flint.html" title="Flint">flint</a>) Marsh biome (same as forest but with <a href="Spiky_Bush.html" title="Spiky Bush">spiky bushes</a> and no grass but <a href="Reeds.html" title="Reeds">reeds</a>).
</p><p>Your preferred biome would be a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grassland.html" title="Grassland">Grassland</a> or a <a href="Savanna.html" title="Savanna">Savanna</a>. Grasslands have small amounts of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Rabbits.html" title="Rabbits">rabbits</a> but fair amount of grass, berry bushes and saplings. Savannas are most preferred. While having no <a class="mw-redirect" href="Saplings.html" title="Saplings">saplings</a> at all you will have an abundant amount of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Grass_Tufts.html" title="Grass Tufts">Grass Tufts</a> and <a href="Rabbit_Hole.html" title="Rabbit Hole">rabbit holes</a>. While having only grass and rabbits, savanna have <a href="Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">beefaloes</a> which can multiply. You can choose to camp near the rabbits and beefalos. But not too close to beefaloes for they are hostile during the Mating Season  which can be seen through their red butts and constant backleg kicking.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_1">Day 1</span></h2>
<p>Start out as exploring most of the map. Pick everything you see, enough to have 15 of everything. Not too fast! Craft an <a href="Axe.html" title="Axe">Axe</a> with flint and twigs that you found and start chopping down <a class="mw-redirect" href="Trees.html" title="Trees">Trees</a>; that's the most important thing you need to do. Stop when you have 9 <a href="Log.html" title="Log">Log</a>, as it is enough. Chopping more trees is just a waste of time.
</p><p>Once you have finished, carry on exploring, probably will be about dusk, but don't make a campfire. It is better to wait until you have 2 spare clocks until night. That is the best moment to make a fire. Then drop 1 log in the campfire and cook some berries (3-4 along with carrots if you want).
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_2">Day 2</span></h2>
<p>After night ended,you want to pick more grass and everything too. When you found savanna, find a good amount of rabbits and make a trap, 6 and more rabbits are preferred,so make a trap around many rabbits. Start exploring more. Its about to be dusk and you may found a rockyland,you had some spare flint? then make a pickaxe,and mine 11 gold veined boulders that drop <a class="mw-redirect" href="Gold_Nuggets.html" title="Gold Nuggets">gold nuggets</a> .once you mined enough, make a fire. cook up 3-4 berries and wait for next day. You may have spare logs, so build a science machine, prototype a shaver (if you need it), a shovel and backpack, soon when the day ends prototype a log suit, a spear and its probably enough. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_3">Day 3</span></h2>
<p>And now, You must dig up everything to about 20 (berry bushes is enough to be 15-10). When done,you must explore more of savanna and when you find a forest  <b>WITHOUT A ROAD, </b>explore it, it may end up into savanna full of beefalo! Beefalo are needed to have infinite amount of fuel without wasting logs, free food source (you can make improved farms with that!).But don't set a fire pit near them. set up where you marked a trap, (so you will have rabbits). make a science machine once again, and chop some trees for logs. it Probably will be night, if you are far from camp make a campfire. and cook berries once again you found while exploring.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_4.2B">Day 4+</span></h2>
<p>During this day, you may take a little rest from exploring. Go back to the beefalo herd and harvest some manure. Once you have harvested 10-20 you may want to go back to your campsite. Now you must plant your saplings, grass tufts, and berry bushes. Fertillize remember to fertilize everything, especially the berry bushes. After the fertilization you may want to prototype an alchemy engine with your science machine: prototype  4 boards along with 2 cut stone, and make a <a href="Alchemy_Engine.html" title="Alchemy Engine">alchemy engine</a> . After these days. you probably want to harvest more Manure and dig up more tufts along with saplings and fertillize them.
</p><p>You can also prototype <a class="mw-redirect" href="Improved_farm.html" title="Improved farm">improved farms</a> to grow <a class="mw-redirect" href="Crops.html" title="Crops">Crops</a> !
</p><p>When you can, you can dig <a class="mw-redirect" href="Graves.html" title="Graves">Graves</a> and find <a href="Gears.html" title="Gears">gears</a>, you can get an ice box with that.
</p><p>You can make a beebox using 4 bees captured with the bug net, 1 honeycomb dropped by bee hive, and 2 boards.
</p><p>Remember to prototype a razor. The goal is to shave at least 6 beefaloes during summer, in order to make clothes for the winter.
</p><p>Get as many reeds as you can, 40 is enough. You can't never say what you will be able to meet!
</p><p><b>Beware of <a class="mw-redirect" href="Hounds.html" title="Hounds">Hounds</a> ! You can lure them to beefaloes if you are risky or tank them, kite them by your style.</b>
</p><p><b>Make a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Crock_pot.html" title="Crock pot">crock pot</a> ! 3 <a href="Berries.html" title="Berries">Berries</a> and 1 <a href="Morsel.html" title="Morsel">Morsel</a>  gained from rabbit  make good <a href="Meatballs.html" title="Meatballs">meatballs</a> !</b>
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Day_21.2B">Day 21+</span></h2>
<p>This is the beginning of the winter. Crops around day 21-23 still grow, but extremely slow, so you don't need to care about crops and grass this winter.If you are low on grass, you probably have 4 silk and 4 beefalo wool you shaved beefalo with,then prototype winter hat in hat section.
</p><p>These days, you probably want to take trips on exploring too, grab <a href="Meatballs.html" title="Meatballs">meatballs</a> that you got, collect <a href="Cut_Grass.html" title="Cut Grass">Cut grass</a> you found and explore.In winter,its dangerous,as you can freeze and die when you don't have fire or have no warm clothing! 
</p><p>There is also danger from <a href="Deerclops.html" title="Deerclops">Deerclops</a>, This is a pain, but he will not come that early, so no worries.
</p><p>When you hear hissing and stomps, run AWAY FROM YOUR BASE!!!! what you need to do is to go to a pig village,you would probably made blow darts by killing <a class="mw-redirect" href="Snowbird.html" title="Snowbird">Snowbird</a>'s  with a <a href="Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">boomerang</a>  and getting hound's tooth from hounds ( you probably did so i guess you're still not dead)
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>To deal with him. the only hope is pigs and yourself, go to pig village when he is chasing you,and let the pigs do the work, pigs are probably dead, so prepare your log suit, spear and football helmet...
</p><p>ATTACK!!!!!!!!!! now with that he is dead due to help of pigs.
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>to be continued...
