<p><a href="Wendy.html" title="Wendy">Wendy</a> is a character suited for mid-tier skill levels as combat is slow and knowledge of kiting is a necessity.
</p><p>She is a melancholy child, accompanied by the ghost of her deceased twin sister <a href="Abigail.html" title="Abigail">Abigail</a>.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Which_biome_should_I_select_for_Wendy.3F">Which biome should I select for Wendy?</span></h2>
<p>Biome selection is similar to the selection for most other characters;
</p><p><a href="Savanna.html" title="Savanna">Savanna</a> is good for rabbits and beefalo.
</p><p><a href="Marsh.html" title="Marsh">Marsh</a> is good for combat training and renewable food, although this is riskier if you are inexperienced at kiting.
</p><p><a href="Forest.html" title="Forest">Forest</a> is good for pigs, as Abigail can aggro them and help you kill them in quite a short time if pulled off correctly.
</p><p><a href="Rockyland.html" title="Rockyland">Rocky</a> is a bad idea due to the lack of food, as tallbirds aren't a very reliable source as they are a dangerous opponent.
</p><p><a href="Mosaic.html" title="Mosaic">Mosaic</a> can be good but it's unwise due to resource spread.
</p><p>Meadow is good as bees can be farmed for honey through Abigail attacking them.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Wendy.27s_Pros_and_Cons">Wendy's Pros and Cons</span></h2>
<p><b>Wendy is a good character for saving on sanity.</b>
</p><p>+ Sanity can be controlled with relative ease.
</p><p>+ Cave dwelling is slightly easier.
</p><p>+ Nightmare fuel farming can be done for long periods of time.
</p><p>+ Suitable for players who wish to try an Always Night world.
</p><p><b>Wendy's decreased damage makes combat slower therefore durability of weapons will be more of an issue.</b>
</p><p>- Because of this boomerangs don't "one-shot" birds or rabbits, so they aren't recommended for basic food gathering.
</p><p>- Bosses will be slower to fight.
</p>
<ul><li>Tip: Since Wendy is a kiting based character, she will lose more sanity in these fights. It would be wise to stock up on sanity foods or <a href="Blow_Dart.html" title="Blow Dart">Blow Darts</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>- Early game combat is most unwise.
</p>
<ul><li>Tip: It's recommended to use <a href="Ham_Bat.html" title="Ham Bat">Ham Bat</a> as a weapon because it has unlimited durability.
</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Abigail.27s_Pros_and_Cons">Abigail's Pros and Cons</span></h2>
<p><b>List of the things that are a good idea to search and kill with Abigail:</b>
</p>
<ol><li>Spiders - A good source of healing items early on, although she may not always be able to handle a tier two nest without dying or being heavily injured.
</li><li>Bees and Killer Bees - Abigail can handle these very well as her AoE can stunlock the surge as it leaves the hive, just don't try to attack too many hives at once.
</li><li>Frogs - since their attack range is short Abigail can deal with many at once, giving you a lot of food.
</li></ol>
<p><br/>
<b>List of things that you generally want to avoid with Abigail:</b>
</p>
<ol><li>Tentacles - Although she can kill one alone it will leave her vulnerable to all enemies which can be bad as swamps are filled with spiders and merms, which, are highly aggressive.
</li><li>Pigs - While in combination with Wendy pigs can be easy prey, alone Abigail is no match for their superior AI, so make sure you know what you are doing before sending her to aggro one.
</li><li>Merms - Same reason as pigs, not to mention they always appear in groups of four will "kill" Abigail quickly and leave her flower stuck in hostile territory.
</li><li>Bosses - All bosses can tank Abigail easily so never send her in alone against them, if you time it right you can distract the bosses while Abigail dishes out the damage.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Other notes about Abigail:</b>
</p>
<ul><li>She can pass through walls.
</li><li>Her AI causes her to try and tank opponents.
</li><li>She is rather slow.
</li><li>Abigail may try to harm Wendy, but the former is completely unable to harm the latter.
</li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summoning_Abigail">Summoning Abigail</span></h2>
<p>Abigail is summoned using her <a href="Abigail%27s_Flower.html" title="Abigail's Flower">flower</a>, when the flower is fully open killing anything (even yourself!) while the flower is on the ground will summon her. However, this will not work if you kill a captured animal by murdering it within the inventory.
</p><p><b>How do I know if the flower is ready?: </b>If you examine it in your inventory, Wendy will say "Abigail's ready to play now, but she needs some space".
</p><p>There is also a graphical difference, the flower will be open and glow slightly when dropped on the ground.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary">Summary</span></h2>
<p>If you survived for very long, congratulations. Now you are a fully fledged Wendy player! May all your future adventures go smoothly!
