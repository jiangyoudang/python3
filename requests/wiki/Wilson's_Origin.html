<p>This <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text exitstitial" href="story.html.html" rel="nofollow">video</a></span>, called <i>Forbidden Knowledge</i>, was found by the clever puzzle-solving minds of the <i>Don't Starve</i> community. It shows how Wilson obtained "forbidden knowledge" and ended up in Maxwell's world.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Video">Video</span></h2>
<p>The video starts off with a different looking logo of Klei Entertainment. It cuts to a bird flying over a forest towards Wilson's house. Through the window, the viewer can see Wilson trying to mix two chemicals together. The chemicals create a small explosion that covers Wilson in ashes and ruffles his hair. Frustrated, he puts his hand to his face as his hair 'unruffles' with a faint 'boing' sound.
</p>
<div class="floatleft"><a class="image" href="File:Wilson%27s_origin_haunted_by_Maxwell.png.html"><img alt="Wilson's origin haunted by Maxwell" data-image-key="Wilson%27s_origin_haunted_by_Maxwell.png" data-image-name="Wilson's origin haunted by Maxwell.png" height="113" src="img/200px-Wilson%27s_origin_haunted_by_Maxwell.png" width="200"/></a></div>After the failure, Wilson sits down, dejected. His radio says to him, "Say pal, looks like you're having some trouble! I have secret knowledge I can share with you. If you think you're ready for it." Wilson agrees to this whilst picking the radio up. The radio says, "Ok then!" For a split second, a silhouette of Maxwell is shown, followed by a scene in which information is transmitted to Wilson through the radio. Among the objects whirling in the air are a hidden link and a turtle-like mob. The screen then closes in on Wilson's frowning face, which slowly turns into a smile.
<p>The scene then fades out and back in to show a montage of Wilson at work. He is shown tying up two rats, typing feverishly on a typewriter, working on a strange machine, and finally, cutting his palm with a long knife. He drips his blood into a beaker with another chemical, causing an explosion.

<div class="floatright"><a class="image" href="File:Excellent.png.html"><img alt="Excellent" data-image-key="Excellent.png" data-image-name="Excellent.png" height="113" src="img/200px-Excellent.png" width="200"/></a></div>
<p>The smoke clears to show Wilson standing back to look at the machine. The radio eggs him to turn the machine on, but Wilson hesitates to pull the switch until the radio yells, "DO IT!" The machine roars to life. The parts move around a bit, and the machine begins to look strikingly similar to a grinning Maxwell, while Maxwell's face flashes on the screen over the image. As the radio cackles, Wilson backs away from the machine in fear. Two shadowy hands come out of the ground in front of the machine before they rise and grab Wilson, dragging him into the floor, presumably pulling him into Maxwell's world. The camera zooms out to show Maxwell's head among storm clouds, looking down at the house and laughing.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Analysis_and_Speculation">Analysis and Speculation</span></h2>
<ul><li>The machine Wilson built is Maxwell's Door. Given this distinct possibility, and the fact that the machine is meant to look like Maxwell's grinning face, It could be that the machine Wilson built either provides Maxwell with a gateway from the world of <i>Don't Starve</i> to Wilson's world, or that it gave Maxwell a physical body to channel his powers through and become the demon he is now. It is also possible that the machine did both of these things, and probable that Maxwell was using the radio simply as a means to communicate, but couldn't properly channel his powers through it, and thus the need for Wilson's machine.
</li><li>Wilson has chained up a skeleton in his house. This might mean he has done human experiments. Another plausible explanation is it is simply kept for reference.
</li><li>Wilson has a sack with chains around it in his shelf. It has a huge resemblance to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="Krampus_Sack.html" title="Krampus Sack">Krampus Sack</a>.

On the video, when Wilson is holding the radio up (~00:40), there is a <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text exitstitial" href="eureka.html.html" rel="nofollow">hidden link</a></span> (in fact http: <a class="external free exitstitial" href="UIBA7P.html" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/UIBA7P</a> is shown in the video) that leads to a page with the machine that Wilson built. Clicking on the machine's lever will turn the machine on and go to a page with concept art on the <i>Don't Starve</i> website, along with a message from Maxwell.<div style="clear:both"></div>

<ul><li> The <a href="Divining_Rod.html" title="Divining Rod">Divining Rod</a> happens to be the radio that Maxwell uses to communicate with Wilson, just on a stick.
