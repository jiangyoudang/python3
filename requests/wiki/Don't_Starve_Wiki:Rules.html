<ul><li>Please see the <a class="mw-redirect" href="Manual_of_Style.html" title="Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a> for information regarding the proper way articles should be written and ordered. It is important to follow these guidelines to keep information in an encyclopedic format.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="General_Rules">General Rules</span></h2>
<ul><li>The Don't Starve wiki is <i>not</i> a social network. Although we are a community of <i>Don't Starve</i> fans and enthusiasts, we are all here to document all knowledge Don't Starve. Utilizing Don't Starve wiki as a means for pure social interaction, I.E. using it as a social network, is frowned upon.
</li><li>Don't Starve may not be used to advertise businesses or boost SEO rankings. Links to external sites for personal gain, that are irrelevant to the wiki, can be removed at any time for any reason.
</li><li>Be polite when interacting with other users. We are all here to work together as a team and as a community. Being polite will go a long way and will make the wiki a happier place to edit.
</li><li>Follow the manual of style, the preferred way of how things are to be organized. While the help pages will help you to understand how to use basic wikia markup, the manual of style will tell you how to apply it on Don't Starve  according to how everything else is organized.
<ul><li>The manual of style is located here: <a class="mw-redirect" href="Manual_of_Style.html" title="Manual of Style">Manual of Style</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Do not start edit wars. Be ready to discuss your changes with others. If you disagree with another editor, discuss the issue on either the user's wall or article's comments. Repeatedly reverting each other's changes, known as "edit warring", is bound to aggravate the conflict instead of solving it. If you cannot reach a consensus, ask an Administrator to mediate.
</li><li>Do not flame or insult other users. Send them a polite message if you have a dispute with another user. Talking things out and working out your differences can go a long way towards a mutual understanding.
</li><li>Abide by all <a class="extiw" href="Terms_of_Use.html" title="w:c:community:Terms of Use">Wikia Terms of Use</a> while on the site (you agreed to these if you made an account).
</li><li>Linking to illegal copies of the game is an instant ban.
</li><li>Do not edit others' user pages, as they are generally considered property of the user. You are, however, more than welcome to put whatever you'd like on your own user page, so long as it doesn't violate any rules or isn't offensive. If you have an issue with another user's user page, contact an Administrator.
</li><li>Do not vandalize any page. Do not remove all the content from a page. It is considered vandalism to remove all the content from a page or to add irrelevant information to the page.
</li><li>Do not plagiarize content from Wikipedia. Write it in your own words. The goal is to write the key ideas in your own words so that you don't plagiarize. This improves your overall credibility.
</li><li>Do not boost for the achievement badges. Badges are meant as a guideline and are in no way to be considered as status symbols. Use them for yourself and feel proud of yourself, do not use them to impress others.
<ul><li><b>What is Boosting?</b> Boosting is the process of making either useless or malicious edits just to heighten the count of edits they have made.
</li><li><b>What is not Boosting?</b> Some things may appear to be boosting, but is not always so. Edit wars between a normal user and a vandal, who is trying to vandalize a page, and the user who is quickly undoing his edits. If the user is signing in and out to vandalize/undo, we can tell by the IP address.
</li><li>Additionally, valid contributions with the aim of garnering an achievement are allowed. Contributors should exercise great caution in ensuring that these additions are pragmatic, useful, and accurate. Such instances will be investigated and reviewed by an administrator.
</li></ul>
</li><li>Multiple accounts used for block-evasion are strictly forbidden and are against Wikia TOS. If you create an addition account to evade a block, it will be permanently blocked and your primary account runs the risk of having it's block duration extended indefinitely.
<ul><li>If you wish to utilize a secondary account for another purpose, please contact an Administrator.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
