This guide concerns sustainable life underground - in <a href="Caves.html" title="Caves">Caves</a> and <a href="Ruins.html" title="Ruins">Ruins</a>. Sustainable life means being able to survive for an indefinite period of time without needing to exit the current level. The guide contains instructions and opinions on the matter, and every player is free to find their own playstile and methods for achieving the goal of sustainable underground life.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Basics_of_the_underground_environment">Basics of the underground environment</span></h2>
<p>Caves and Ruins are free from all weather - it is permanently <a href="Summer.html" title="Summer">Summer</a>, with a constant temperature and no Rain or Lightning. Occasionally, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Earthquakes.html" title="Earthquakes">Earthquakes</a> can happen on both levels, which drop <a href="Rocks.html" title="Rocks">Rocks</a>, <a href="Flint.html" title="Flint">Flint</a>, <a href="Nitre.html" title="Nitre">Nitre</a>, <a href="Gold_Nugget.html" title="Gold Nugget">Gold Nuggets</a>, <a href="Red_Gem.html" title="Red Gem">Red Gems</a>, <a href="Blue_Gem.html" title="Blue Gem">Blue Gems</a>, or <a href="Marble.html" title="Marble">Marble</a>, but the falling minerals will damage the player if they manage to directly hit them. It is permanently dark, and the player loses 5 <a href="Sanity.html" title="Sanity">Sanity</a> per minute, regardless of the time of day. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Caves"><b>Caves</b></span></h3>
<p>Caves have a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Day.html" title="Day">day</a> and night cycle, as well as a <a href="Moon_Cycle.html" title="Moon Cycle">Moon Cycle</a>, although neither is clearly visible (there is no clock in the top right corner of the screen). The current state could be determined by listening to the music and by checking into a shaft of natural light. The shafts of natural light are patches of ground where light reaches from the surface. They could contain <a class="mw-redirect" href="Evergreen.html" title="Evergreen">Evergreens</a>, <a href="Grass_Tuft.html" title="Grass Tuft">Grass Tufts</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Saplings.html" title="Saplings">Saplings</a>, or <a href="Berry_Bush.html" title="Berry Bush">Berry Bushes</a>, or they could be in an underground <a href="Marsh.html" title="Marsh">Marsh</a>. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ruins"><b>Ruins</b></span></h3>
<p>Ruins have no day and night cycle - it is permanent night for gameplay purposes. This means that surface animals that have been brought down - <a href="Pig.html" title="Pig">Pigs</a>, <a href="Rabbit.html" title="Rabbit">Rabbits</a>, <a href="Bee.html" title="Bee">Bees</a>, <a href="Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">Beefalo</a>, or Flying <a href="Birds.html" title="Birds">Birds</a> - are always asleep. Instead, there is a <a href="Nightmare_Cycle.html" title="Nightmare Cycle">Nightmare Cycle</a>, which alters the appearance of the place and causes <a href="Shadow_Creature.html" title="Shadow Creature">Shadow Creatures</a> to spawn from <a href="Nightmare_Light.html" title="Nightmare Light">Nightmare Lights</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Nightmare_Fissure.html" title="Nightmare Fissure">Nightmare Fissures</a>. There are no shafts of natural light and there is no way to tell what time is it. The Moon Cycle still affects the Ruins, albeit invisible. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Preparation">Preparation</span></h2>
<p>Before being able to live sustainably and indefinitely underground, one needs to gather all the non-renewable resources, required for sustainable life above ground. These include, but are not limited to: Grass Tufts, Sapplings, Berry Bushes, <a href="Honeycomb.html" title="Honeycomb">Honeycombs</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bees.html" title="Bees">Bees</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Pine_Cones.html" title="Pine Cones">Pine Cones</a>, <a href="Pig_Skin.html" title="Pig Skin">Pigskin</a>, <a href="Seeds.html" title="Seeds">Seeds</a>, <a href="Fleshy_Bulb.html" title="Fleshy Bulb">Fleshy Bulbs</a>, and a living Flying Bird. These would enable resources, such as Grass, Twigs, Berries (with occasional <a class="mw-redirect" href="Gobblers.html" title="Gobblers">Gobblers</a>), Honey and Bees, Logs and Living Logs, and Pigskins to become renewable underground. The remaining resources, required for the construction of a camp underground, such as Gold and Rocks are already renewable and highly abundant there.
</p><p>Also, because followers could be brought down, one can lure up to 5 <a href="Beefalo.html" title="Beefalo">Beefalo</a> at a time and make <a href="Beefalo_Wool.html" title="Beefalo Wool">Beefalo Wool</a>, <a href="Meat.html" title="Meat">Meat</a> and <a href="Beefalo_Horn.html" title="Beefalo Horn">Beefalo Horns</a> a renewable resource underground. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Location_of_the_camp">Location of the camp</span></h2>
<p>In Caves, there are shafts of natural light containing Evergreens, Grass Tufts, Sapplings, and Berry Bushes. Rarely, the Shaft could also contain a version of the Cave Camp <a href="Set_Piece.html" title="Set Piece">Set Piece</a>, which includes a Frog <a href="Pond.html" title="Pond">Pond</a>. These shafts are a good place for the camp (except if the shaft contains a Pond, in which case <a class="mw-redirect" href="Frogs.html" title="Frogs">Frogs</a> will be a constant nuicance). Try to place your <a href="Tent.html" title="Tent">Tent</a> inside such a shaft, so when you sleep and your fires are extinguished, you don`t wake up in total darkness.
</p><p>In Ruins, there are no shafts of natural light and there are Nightmare Lights and Nightmare Fissures, which will spawn Shadow Creatures during the Nightmare Phase. The camp should be placed as far away from any Nightmare Lights and Fissures as possible. A good camp location is on the edge of a Light Flower field. <a class="mw-redirect" href="Walls.html" title="Walls">Walls</a> (upgraded at least once) could be used to keep Shadow creatures from randomly wandering inside the camp. Try to place the Tent by a <a href="Light_Flower.html" title="Light Flower">Light Flower</a>, so when you sleep and all your fires are extinguished, you don`t wake up in total darkness. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Keeping_the_lights_on">Keeping the lights on</span></h2>
<p>Probably the highest priority in Caves and Ruins is to always have access to a source of light. Without a source of light, one is vulnerable to attacks from <a class="mw-redirect" href="Charlie.html" title="Charlie">Charlie</a> and cannot do almost anything.
</p><p>For a mobile source of light, the best ones are the <a href="Miner_Hat.html" title="Miner Hat">Miner Hat</a> and the <a href="Lantern.html" title="Lantern">Lantern</a>. Both are refuelable (with <a href="Slurtle_Slime.html" title="Slurtle Slime">Slurtle Slime</a>, <a href="Fireflies.html" title="Fireflies">Fireflies</a>, or <a class="mw-redirect" href="Light_Bulbs.html" title="Light Bulbs">Light Bulbs</a>) and both could be used in such a way that you could swing a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Weapon.html" title="Weapon">weapon</a> while still having light. The Miner Hat prevents you from wearing head <a href="Armor.html" title="Armor">armor</a>, but it keeps your hands free. The Lantern allows you to wear head armor, but has to be placed on the ground before equipping a weapon, and at that point it becomes a static light source. It could also be stolen by <a class="mw-redirect" href="Splumonkeys.html" title="Splumonkeys">Splumonkeys</a> if put on the ground, which causes it to stop emiting light. 
</p><p>For fueling the Miner Hat and Lantern, one could use Fireflies, Light Bulbs and Slurtle Slime. Fireflies are not renewable, so it is not a good idea to use them, unless there is no alternative. Light Bulbs and Slutrle Slime are both renewable. A Slutrle Slime grants 45 seconds of light and could be stored without spoiling. The Light Bulb grants 90 seconds of light, but spoils in 6 days. If the Light Bulbs are kept in the inventory (and not in an <a href="Ice_Box.html" title="Ice Box">Ice Box</a>) and the Miner Hat or Lantern is lit for the entire time, one needs 32 Light Bulbs (at 0% spoilage) to have light for the full 6 days before they spoil. Any additional Light Bulbs picked are a waste of resources. 
</p><p>As for static light sources, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="Fire_pit.html" title="Fire pit">Firepit</a> is the best one for Caves. If Beefalo have been brought from above, Beefalo Wool or <a href="Manure.html" title="Manure">Manure</a> could be used as easy to obtain and renewable fuel sources. Otherwise, Logs could be burned as well. For the Ruins, due to the abundance of <a href="Nightmare_Fuel.html" title="Nightmare Fuel">Nightmare Fuel</a>, the <a href="Night_Light.html" title="Night Light">Night Light</a> is a very efficient static light source. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Keeping_Sanity_up">Keeping Sanity up</span></h2>
<p>Unless you`re playing as <a href="Maxwell_(Character).html" title="Maxwell (Character)">Maxwell</a>, you will need to replenish your sanity in one way or another. Remember, you`re trying to be completely self-sufficient for an indefinite period of time inside the Caves or Ruins, so items like the <a href="Dapper_Vest.html" title="Dapper Vest">Dapper Vest</a>, the <a href="Tam_o%27_Shanter.html" title="Tam o' Shanter">Tam o` Shanter</a>, the <a href="Sewing_Kit.html" title="Sewing Kit">Sewing Kit</a>, and <a href="Mushrooms.html" title="Mushrooms">Mushrooms</a> are not renewable ways to keep sane. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sleeping"><b>Sleeping</b></span></h3>
<p>As with above ground, <a href="Sleeping.html" title="Sleeping">sleeping</a> can provide an instant sanity boost, albeit at the cost of hunger. Before choosing this method for staying sane, one must ensure a steady food supply or at least a good stockpile of food. It is important to be noted that when sleeping, a Miner Hat or a Lantern will still lose fuel, and all fires (including Night Lights) will be immediately extinguished. If the Tent or <a href="Bed_Roll.html" title="Bed Roll">Bed Roll</a> is used while there is no natural light around, and the equipped light source does not have enough fuel to last until the next day, the player will wake up in total darkness, which could nullify any sanity gain and cause Charlie to attack, if a light source is not found quickly enough. In order to counter this, in Caves one could sleep in a shaft of light, or near a Light Flower or Mushtree. In Ruins, the available options are near Light Flowers, or near an <a href="Ancient_Pseudoscience_Station.html" title="Ancient Pseudoscience Station">Ancient Pseudoscience Station</a>. Additionally, to avoid losing fuel for the mobile light sources, they could be unequipped.
</p><p>It is worth noting that sleeping in the Ruins will advance time to the next stage of the Nightmare Cycle, but may prevent Shadow Creatures from dying if time is advanced from Nightmare to Calm. In this case, the creatures will die in the next cycle.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Clothing"><b>Clothing</b></span></h3>
<p>Most <a class="mw-redirect" href="Clothing.html" title="Clothing">clothing</a> items which restore sanity are non-renewable in Caves and Ruins, because in order to keep them repaired, one needs a Sewing Kit, which requires <a href="Hound%27s_Tooth.html" title="Hound's Tooth">Hound`s Teeth</a> - a nonrenewable resource underground. However, it is possible to recover Sanity though clothes alone while keeping them renewable (sort of). A <a href="Top_Hat.html" title="Top Hat">Top Hat</a> is a renewable item of clothing and restores 3.3 Sanity per minute. The <a href="Thulecite_Suit.html" title="Thulecite Suit">Thulecite Suit</a>, which can be crafted in the Ruins and brought to the Caves does not degrade (unless actively used as armor) and also restores 3.3 Sanity per minute. Together both items restore 1.6 Sanity per minute more than the constant sanity drain inside Caves and Ruins. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Food"><b>Food</b></span></h3>
<p>Any of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="Crock_Pot_Recipes.html" title="Crock Pot Recipes">Crock Pot Dishes</a> will restore 5 sanity, but in order to efficienly keep sane, one can rely on the <a href="Pumpkin_Cookie.html" title="Pumpkin Cookie">Pumpkin Cookie</a>, <a href="Taffy.html" title="Taffy">Taffy</a>, or <a href="Jerky.html" title="Jerky">Jerky</a> / <a href="Small_Jerky.html" title="Small Jerky">Small Jerky</a>, which restore up to 15 Sanity each (Small Jerky restores 10). 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Resources">Resources</span></h2>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cut_Grass_and_Twigs"><b>Cut Grass and Twigs</b></span></h3>
<p>In Caves, Grass Tufts and Sapplings could sometimes be found in shafts of light, making Cut Grass and Twigs renewable. 
</p><p>In Ruins, if Grass Tufts and Sapplings are brought from above, Cut Grass and Twigs could be made renewable.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Logs_and_Living_Logs"><b>Logs and Living Logs</b></span></h3>
<p>In Caves, Evergreens could sometimes be found in shafts of light, making <a class="mw-redirect" href="Logs.html" title="Logs">Logs</a> renewable. Cutting down Evergreens could spawn a <a href="Treeguard.html" title="Treeguard">Treeguard</a>, so <a class="mw-redirect" href="Living_Logs.html" title="Living Logs">Living Logs</a> are also renewable.
</p><p>In Ruins, if Pinecones have been brought from above, Logs could be made renewable. Cutting down Evergreens could spawn a Treeguard, so Living Logs could also be made renewable.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reeds"><b>Reeds</b></span></h3>
<p>In Caves, sometimes there could be underground marshes, containing <a href="Reeds.html" title="Reeds">reeds</a>.
</p><p>In Ruins, there is no way to obtain Reeds, or to make them renewable.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Minerals_and_Gems"><b>Minerals and Gems</b></span></h3>
<p>In both Caves and Ruins, Rocks, Flint, Nitre, Gold, and <a href="Marble.html" title="Marble">Marble</a> are renewable through Earthquakes. Rocks and Flint could also be obtained from <a class="mw-redirect" href="Rock_Lobsters.html" title="Rock Lobsters">Rock Lobsters</a>. Of the Gems, only the <a href="Red_Gem.html" title="Red Gem">Red Gem</a>, <a href="Blue_Gem.html" title="Blue Gem">Blue Gem</a> and <a href="Purple_Gem.html" title="Purple Gem">Purple Gem</a> are renewable.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beefalo_Wool"><b>Beefalo Wool</b></span></h3>
<p>If Beefalo have been brought from above, they can be shaved at night or killed for Beefalo Wool. In Ruins, because the Beefalo are permanently asleep, they could be shaved at any tme, as long as their wool has grown back. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Food_2"><span style="font-size:20px;">Food</span></span></h2>
<p>Here will be listed some of the available renewable <a href="Food.html" title="Food">food</a> sources in Caves and Ruins.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Meat"><b>Meat</b></span></h3>
<p>In Caves, <a href="Meat.html" title="Meat">Meat</a> could be obtained from <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bunnymen.html" title="Bunnymen">Bunnymen</a>, Beefalo (if brought from above), <a class="mw-redirect" href="Pigs.html" title="Pigs">Pigs</a> (if brought from above or if <a class="mw-redirect" href="Pig_Houses.html" title="Pig Houses">Pig Houses</a> are constructed), and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Rock_Lobsters.html" title="Rock Lobsters">Rock Lobsters</a>, all of which are renewable. The only way to renewably obtain <a href="Morsel.html" title="Morsel">Morsels</a> in Caves is to kill baby Beefalo that have been brought from above. 
</p><p>In Ruins, Meat could be obtained by Rock Lobsters (if brought from above), Beefalo (if brought from above) and Bunnymen. Pigs will not leave their houses in the Ruins, because it is considered permenent night. The Beefalo will be permanently asleep, but can still reproduce and be killed for Meat. Morsels can be renewably obtained from Splumonkeys. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Jerky_.2F_Small_Jerky"><b>Jerky / Small Jerky</b></span></h3>
<p>One could build <a class="mw-redirect" href="Drying_Racks.html" title="Drying Racks">Drying Racks</a> underground to obtain Jerky and Small Jerky, which is a great way to stay well fed and sane at the same time. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Berries_and_Gobblers"><b>Berries and Gobblers</b></span></h3>
<p>Caves sometimes contain Berry Bushes, so a berry farm could be created there. Gobblers could spawn and eat the berries as in the world above. Walling off the farm would make it easier to kill any Gobblers that spawn. The only renewable ranged weapon underground is the <a href="Boomerang.html" title="Boomerang">Boomerang</a>, so this could be used as well. 
</p><p>For Ruins, if Berry Bushes have been brought from above, a berry farm could be created there as well. Because it is permanent night, any spawning Gobblers will immediately return inside the bush that spawned them.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Honey"><b>Honey</b></span></h3>
<p>If <a href="Honeycomb.html" title="Honeycomb">Honeycombs</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Bees.html" title="Bees">Bees</a> have been brought from above, <a href="Bee_Box.html" title="Bee Box">bee boxes</a> could be constructed underground. However, both in Caves and Ruins, the Bees will never come out to gather from <a class="mw-redirect" href="Flowers.html" title="Flowers">flowers</a>. In Caves, the Bees could be forced out by harvesting their box and will remain out until Dusk, gathering from nearby flowers, if one has planted <a class="mw-redirect" href="Butterflies.html" title="Butterflies">butterflies</a>. In Ruins, the Bees could also be forced out by harvesting the box, but will immediately return inside once they disengage the player. 
</p><p>Instead, if the Bee Boxes are built far enough away from the camp, then the game will switch to a simplified model of <a href="Honey.html" title="Honey">honey</a> production, producing one honey per day. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Fish.2C_Frogs.2C_and_Eels"><b>Fish, Frogs, and Eels</b></span></h3>
<p>In Caves, a shaft of light with a Pond could sometimes be found, where <a href="Fish.html" title="Fish">Fish</a> and <a href="Frog_Legs.html" title="Frog Legs">Frog Legs</a> could be obtained. 
</p><p>In Ruins, there are always ponds, which could be fished for <a href="Eel.html" title="Eel">Eels</a>. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Eggs_and_Seeds"><b>Eggs and Seeds</b></span></h3>
<p>If a captured live <a href="Birds.html" title="Birds">bird</a> has been brought from above, a <a href="Birdcage.html" title="Birdcage">Birdcage</a> could be constructed underground, which enables the renewability of <a href="Seeds.html" title="Seeds">Seeds</a>, <a href="Crop_Seeds.html" title="Crop Seeds">Crop Seeds</a>, and <a href="Eggs.html" title="Eggs">Eggs</a>. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Vegetables_and_Fruits"><b>Vegetables and Fruits</b></span></h3>
<p>In Caves, <a class="mw-redirect" href="Farms.html" title="Farms">farms</a> could be constructed in shafts of light and vegetables and fruits could be grown there. <a href="Manure.html" title="Manure">Manure</a>, <a href="Rot.html" title="Rot">Rot</a>, <a href="Rotten_Egg.html" title="Rotten Egg">Rotten Eggs</a>, and <a href="Guano.html" title="Guano">Guano</a> are renewable fertilizers in Caves.
</p><p>In Ruins, crops will not grow on their own and require fertilization. Manure, Rot and Rotten Eggs are renewable fertilizers in Ruins (Manure is dropped by Splumonkeys as a form of ranged attack).
</p><p>In both Caves and Ruins, Seeds have to be brought from above and renewed through feeding some of the crops to a caged bird. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bananas_and_Lichen"><b>Bananas and Lichen</b></span></h3>
<p>Ruins have two unique renewable food sources - the <a href="Cave_Banana.html" title="Cave Banana">Cave Banana</a> and the <a href="Lichen.html" title="Lichen">Lichen</a>. The Bananas grow on Cave Banana Trees and are dropped by Splumonkeys. The Lichen grows randomly in certain areas of the Ruins. Both of these food sources are impossible to relocate and therefore are only found in the ruins.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cooked_food"><b>Cooked food</b></span></h3>
<p>A <a class="mw-redirect" href="Crock_pot.html" title="Crock pot">crock pot</a> could be constructed underground, both in Caves and Ruins, and give access to all <a class="mw-redirect" href="Crock_Pot_recipes.html" title="Crock Pot recipes">crock pot recipes</a> that could be made with the available ingredients. Notable useful dishes are <a href="Taffy.html" title="Taffy">Taffy</a> and <a href="Pumpkin_Cookie.html" title="Pumpkin Cookie">Pumpkin Cookie</a> - for sanity restoration; <a href="Meatballs.html" title="Meatballs">Meatballs</a>, <a href="Honey_Ham.html" title="Honey Ham">Honey Ham</a>, and <a href="Dragonpie.html" title="Dragonpie">Dragonpie</a> - for efficient nutrition; <a href="Fishsticks.html" title="Fishsticks">Fishsticks</a> (always available in Ruins and sometimes available in Caves) - for healing. 
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Monster_Meat"><b>Monster Meat</b></span></h3>
<p>While not a good food item on its own, <a href="Monster_Meat.html" title="Monster Meat">Monster Meat</a> could be used as an ingredient in many Crock Pot Recipes, as well as fed to a caged bird for eggs. It is made renewable through the attacks of <a href="Depths_Worm.html" title="Depths Worm">Depths Worms</a> and through killing <a class="mw-redirect" href="Spiders.html" title="Spiders">Spiders</a>, all of which are abundant in both Caves and Ruins.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Leafy_Meat"><b>Leafy Meat</b></span></h3>
<p>If <a href="Fleshy_Bulb.html" title="Fleshy Bulb">Fleshy Bulbs</a> have been brought from above, a <a href="Lureplant.html" title="Lureplant">Lureplant</a> could be planted underground, enabling the renewability of <a href="Leafy_Meat.html" title="Leafy Meat">Leafy Meat</a>. A good location for a Leafy Meat Farm is on <a href="Cave_Rock_Turf.html" title="Cave Rock Turf">Cave Rock Turf</a> or <a href="Rocky_Turf.html" title="Rocky Turf">Rocky Turf</a>, in order to make it easier to collect the Leafy Meat.
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tools.2C_weapons_and_armor">Tools, weapons and armor</span></h2>
<p>Because Gold, Flint, Twigs, Cut Grass and Rocks are all renewable in Caves, all <a class="mw-redirect" href="Tools.html" title="Tools">tools</a> are renewable there. As for Ruins, one needs to bring only Grass Tufts and Sapplings in order to make all tools renewable. It should be noted that Gold tools are a more efficient use of Twigs, therefore they are preferred over the Flint ones.  
</p><p>As for weapons, all except the <a href="Thulecite_Club.html" title="Thulecite Club">Thulecite Club</a> and <a href="Tentacle_Spike.html" title="Tentacle Spike">Tentacle Spike</a> are renewable in Caves (if Pig Houses have been constructed). In Ruins, all except the Thulecite Club, Tentacle Spike, <a href="Bat_Bat.html" title="Bat Bat">Bat Bat</a> and <a href="Ham_Bat.html" title="Ham Bat">Ham Bat</a> are renewable. 
</p><p>Of the armor, all except the <a href="Thulecite_Suit.html" title="Thulecite Suit">Thulecite Suit</a> and <a href="Thulecite_Crown.html" title="Thulecite Crown">Thulecite Crown</a> are renewable in Caves. In Ruins, no armor is renewable, unless Grass Tufts and Pine Cones have been brought from above, in which case the <a href="Grass_Suit.html" title="Grass Suit">Grass Suit</a>, <a href="Log_Suit.html" title="Log Suit">Log Suit</a>, <a href="Marble_Suit.html" title="Marble Suit">Marble Suit</a>, and <a href="Beekeeper_Hat.html" title="Beekeeper Hat">Beekeeper Hat</a> could be made renewable. 
</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>With the right preparation, it is possible to survive indefinitely underground. Of course, non-renewable items could also be brought to make the experience far easier - for example a <a href="Tam_o%27_Shanter.html" title="Tam o' Shanter">Tam</a> and a stack of Hound`s Teeth, which will last for a very long time (although not indefinitely). Although there is no real point in prolonged life underground, it can be a good challenge and could diversify your Don`t Starve experience.
