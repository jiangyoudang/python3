Anywhere in the <a href="Map.html" title="Map">map</a> is possible to built a Rock Lobster Pen assuming it is passable, has enough space, and has no other objects that are blocking the area. But it would become useless if a pen is built too far from a strategic point. After all its the players decision where he/she wants build it.

<dl><dd><dl><dd> The second step is to build a series of wall columns with a minimum gap between them in a square pattern. The Minimum area required should be 5 by 5 columns of walls and one side of the area shall remain open to serve as an entrance way. The required type of wall should be <a class="mw-redirect" href="Walls#Stone_Wall.html" title="Walls">stone</a> because it is not flammable, second to the most sturdy, and more common than <a href="Thulecite.html" title="Thulecite">Thulecite</a>.

Feeding them with <a href="Category:Minerals.html" title="Category:Minerals">minerals</a> will cause them to follow the character. Once they are inside the pen, the player can now block the open side of the pen. Due to lobster's big body, it will not be able to pass the small gap between the columns. Before going somewhere, the player must wait or make sure that the loyalty of these mobs are over. Otherwise, they will follow the character even if they were trap in the pen.

<dl><dd><dl><dd> If a character fails to hide in time and has been chased by these worms, the best choice is to run and lure those worms to the nearest pen.

Try to loose those worms near the vicinity of the pen, once this is done the worm will aggro the lobsters leading them to their deaths.

<dl><dd><dl><dd> For Hounds in the surface, it will be a different strategy. Hounds will sometimes destroy walls instead of attacking the lobsters. A character cannot outrun them so easily even if wearing with a Walking cane. If being chased, the strategy is to run around the vicinity of the pen in circle until all of them loose interest to the character or aggro the lobsters.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tips">Tips</span></h2>
<ul><li>In caves and ruins, walls can be damage by falling minerals little by little during <a href="Earthquake.html" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a>. The best practice to avoid this is to maintain a distance at least 1 to 2 screens away.
</li><li>This guide is NOT effective when dealing with any giants.
</li><li>This Guide is also effective in <a href="Spider.html" title="Spider">Spider</a> Farming and <a href="Frog.html" title="Frog">Frog</a> Extermination during Frog Rain
</li><li>To determine if the lobster is still loyal to the character just point the cursor to it. When it reads "Examine Rock Lobster" mean its still loyal. If it reads "Attack" then its not loyal anymore.
</li><li>It is a bad idea to bring companion like <a href="Chester.html" title="Chester">Chester</a> because some of the worms will attack Chester instead. Better to leave him somewhere far and safe.
</li><li>There worms which are not a member of a wave. They can be found lurking in theÂ  <a href="Mushtree_Forest.html" title="Mushtree Forest">Mushtree Forest</a> and <a href="Wilds.html" title="Wilds">Wilds</a>. They will not chase the player forever.
</li><li>It is required to eliminate each member of the wave. If some of those worms or hounds left alive, they are a threat to a player exploring the world.
</li><li>Putting <a href="Category:Flammable_Objects.html" title="Category:Flammable Objects">Flammable Objects</a> near the pen would be a bad idea because <a class="mw-redirect" href="Fire_Hounds.html" title="Fire Hounds">Fire Hounds</a> drops "Fiery Objects" upon death.
</li><li>Sometimes, items that has been drop too close to a wall column or lobster may slide away from the pen at a great distance. Including those "Fiery Object" being drop by a Fire Hound when killed. It may set flammable objects on fire even if they are far away.
</li><li><a href="Red_Gem.html" title="Red Gem">Red</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Blue_Gems.html" title="Blue Gems">Blue Gems</a> drop by a Fire and <a class="mw-redirect" href="Ice_Hound.html" title="Ice Hound">Ice Hound</a> will be eaten by a lobster. Be sure to grab them as soon as possible.
